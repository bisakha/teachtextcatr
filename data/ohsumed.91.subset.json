One hundred and nine women underwent 110 TAC-WBC scans. One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis. Twenty-six women had appendicitis, 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%), nine of whom had appendicitis. Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology. There were 16 true positives, 5 false positives, 36 true negatives, and 1 false negative. The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%, and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%. The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women. The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC scan is its high indeterminate rate."}

Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia."}

Round foci of PVH surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were observed in 4 infants (PVH pattern I).

Brain death was determined by absence of brainstem function, including loss of all cranial nerve responses and sustained apnea (PCO2 greater than 60 torr) for 48 hours with confirmation of findings by an outside consulting child neurologist. The initial examinations of these 12 infants revealed spontaneous movements and startle myoclonus (12), suck, root, and gag responses (7), increased tone (8), deep tendon reflexes (9), absent pupillary responses (9), absent oculocephalic and corneal responses (6), absent auditory/Moro responses (7), and nonvisualization of the optic nerve (8). Mild depression of neurologic function occurred during the first several days of life; subsequently, the infants' responses were easier to elicit and more sustained. Only 2 infants met the clinical criteria for brain death. Neuropathologic findings indicated that observed complex motor responses were not based upon cortical activity because no infant had a normally-formed cerebrum. Brainstem neuronal activity may have accounted for these motor responses in some patients but even at this level neurons were scanty or absent. Our findings suggest that, although rare, clinical brain death can be determined in liveborn anencephalic infants; ophthalmologic and otologic developmental abnormalities may confound examination of cranial nerve function; and absence of cortical neurons supports the widely held opinion that these infants do not experience sensation."}

Both strains had higher affinity to the epithelial cells of children than to those of adults. In children, the adherence was significantly greater in patients with otitis media with effusion than in normal subjects. Secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions was found to have antibody activity against the bacteria. Adherence of both bacteria was significantly smaller in the group having secretory IgA antibody activity than in the group having no activity. These results suggest that bacterial adherence to the nasopharynx may play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in children, and that secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions may be related to the decrease of adherence."}

On multivariate analysis, prior radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for both men (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1) and women (OR = 2.3). Among women, higher educational attainment (OR = 2.4), alcohol use (OR = 2.0), and hairdye use (OR = 2.5) were also significantly associated with risk.

Total wart regression without recurrence was achieved with Photofrin II and the gold vapor laser at all light dosages. The difference observed between the argon-dye laser and the gold vapor laser might be explained by the pulsed nature of the gold vapor laser, with its high-peak powers, some 5000 x the average measured light dose. In this model, the smaller, less cornified lesions were more effectively treated with photodynamic therapy."}

We found nodes measuring 10 mm or more with central low density always to be malignant. Because CT scanning seems to offer little advantage over palpation in the nonirradiated neck, it should not be regarded as an essential tool in the staging of nodal disease.

Intraobserver and interobserver variability were assessed by regression analysis. Individual components of variance (subject, reader, beat, day, and tracing) were estimated in a subset of five patients and five normal subjects, and estimated total variance defined for each group. Temporal (day-to-day) variability for 95% confidence was estimated for these patients and for normal subjects. Temporal variability in the group from which the subsets were drawn was measured from absolute and percent change in values on two occasions. Estimated and observed 95% confidence limits were compared. Intersubject variability was the largest component of variance in both transplant recipients and in normal subjects. For all indexes in transplant recipients (in the absence of rejection) and normal subjects, observed absolute mean differences (+/- 2 standard deviations) between values from recordings taken on two different days were larger than the 95% confidence limits estimated from the components of variance analysis.

Biventricular stroke volumes were measured in 10 normal subjects for validation of methods and differed by 2.8%. Reading errors were 3.7%. Signal quality improved between the first and last observation (p less than 0.05). Velocity signals were corrected for intercept angles, which averaged 12 and 19 degrees for right heart flows and 31 and 32 degrees for the left side of the heart in all subjects. Negative correlations occurred between intercept angles and the chronologic order in which the patients were studied for left (p = 0.02) and right (p = 0.05) flows. Mean flow areas varied 9% in the left ventricle and 20% in the right ventricle. Total variability for measuring flow determined from control values was 11% to 13%. When twice the variability was used as the detectable level of change, only exercise provoked real increases in biventricular flows in the majority of patients. We conclude that serial measurements of flow by Doppler echocardiographic methods had to exceed 20% to 25% to achieve significant change.

In normal patients there was brisk propagation of inflow velocity to the apex. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated delayed propagation and prolongation of the duration of inflow compared with control subjects (p less than 0.04). Continuous apical flow was visualized in 25% of dilated cardiomyopathies and in no normal patients. Apical velocities were significantly increased in cardiomyopathies with significant mitral regurgitation. Outflow velocities were decreased in dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and apical dyskinesis, flow directed toward the base was measured in the middle left ventricle during isovolumic relaxation secondary to dyskinetic rebound.

Although significant differences between absolute values for peak velocities and velocity time integrals at these sample volume locations have previously been reported, no information exists that has compared changes in inflow profiles after an intervention to improve left ventricular filling. To address this question, 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 50 +/- 13 mm Hg) caused by chronic thromboembolic disease were studied with use of Doppler echocardiography immediately before and after surgical reduction of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 916 +/- 413 to 233 +/- 89 dynes.sec.cm5). This clinical model has been shown to have abnormal mitral inflow velocity profiles that improve markedly after surgery. Doppler measures of early and late peak velocities were significantly lower both before and after surgery when sampling at the mitral anulus compared with the leaflet tips, although late filling parameters and the deceleration of early flow velocity tended to differ little. With surgery, the significant increase in peak early velocity and the ratio of early to late velocity was present regardless of the sample volume location (peak E at leaflet tips, 47.1 +/- 16.0 to 68.9 +/- 15.4 [p less than 0.001], and at anulus, 40.7 +/- 11.3 to 56.2 +/- 14.6 cm/sec [p less than 0.001]; peak E/A at leaflet tips, 0.95 +/- 0.4 to 1.55 +/- 0.9, and at anulus, 0.78 +/- 0.3 to 1.32 +/- 0.7 [both p less than 0.02]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

To investigate how various color flow mapping instruments display disturbed flow information, color image processing was used to evaluate the most common velocity-variance color encoding algorithms of seven commercially available ultrasound machines. In six of seven machines, green was reportedly added by the variance display algorithms to map areas of disturbed flow. The amount of green intensity added to each pixel along the red and blue portions of the velocity reference color bar was calculated for each machine. In this study, velocities displayed on the reference color bar ranged from +/- 46 to +/- 64 cm/sec, depending on the Nyquist limit. Of note, changing the Nyquist limits depicted on the color reference bars did not change the distribution of the intensities of red, blue, or green within the contour of the reference map, but merely assigned different velocities to the pixels. Most color flow mapping algorithms in our study added increasing intensities of green to increasing positive (red) or negative (blue) velocities along their color reference bars. Most of these machines also added increasing green to red and blue color intensities horizontally across their reference bars as a marker of increased variance (spectral broadening). However, at any given velocity, marked variations were noted between different color flow mapping instruments in the amount of green added to their color velocity reference bars.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position. The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm, grouped at 0.1 cm intervals. As the aortic root size enlarged, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient, r = 0.75). At an aortic root size in the \"small normal\" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%. In the \"intermediate\" and \"top normal\" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%. With aortic root dilation, the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%. The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified. Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation. Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes. Throughout the range of aortic root sizes, mild aortic regurgitation predominated. We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the \"top normal\" size range, that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size, and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation."}

M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography could not reliably distinguish patients with severe aortic stenosis from those with milder obstructions. The hemodynamic information offered by Doppler complemented echocardiographic imaging and provided an alternative modality for evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis. By application of the modified Bernoulli equation, the pressure gradient across the stenotic aortic valve could be estimated by Doppler echocardiography. Though helpful and widely used, the information provided by the pressure gradient across the valve about the severity of the obstruction was not complete. The assessment of valvular aortic stenosis therefore includes an estimation of the valve area by application of the continuity equation. This review examines the maturation of the continuity equation by Doppler techniques and discusses the implications of the procedure."}

Possible differences in the measurement of the isovolumic relaxation time were studied when these landmarks were used in 44 healthy people, 14 patients with mitral stenosis, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by recording M mode echograms of the mitral valve, and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra of transmitral flow, with simultaneous electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms. A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However, when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation, the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals, by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation. These intervals cannot be used interchangeably to measure \"isovolumic relaxation time\"."}

A group of 14 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) was studied (11 with peripheral blood cytopenias). The CD4+ helper cells in the bone marrow were found positive for HIV-1 DNA in all patients. In contrast, CD34+ progenitor cells were positive in only one patient. Two monocyte samples and two samples of CD4-/CD34- lymphocytes/blasts (mainly B and CD8 lymphocytes) were positive. Proviral DNA could not be detected in granulocytes. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was not altered in the bone marrow of AIDS patients in comparison with the HIV-1 seronegative controls. In contrast, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes was markedly reduced in the bone marrow of AIDS patients.

The blood leukocyte counts temporarily increased in eight patients 1.5- to 3.3-fold (median, 1.8-fold), mainly due to an increase in the number of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In two patients, bone marrow cellularity increased from 7% to 33% and from 10% to 80%, respectively, but without resulting in a substantial improvement of peripheral blood counts.

Alternatively spliced transcripts of the human CSF-1 gene encode at least two different transmembrane precursors that are differentially processed in mammalian expression systems. The larger precursor rapidly undergoes proteolysis to yield the secreted growth factor and does not give rise to forms of CSF-1 detected on the cell surface. By contrast, the smaller human CSF-1 precursor is stably expressed on the plasma membrane where it is inefficiently cleaved to release a soluble molecule. To determine whether the smaller precursor is biologically active on the cell surface, mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing the different forms of human CSF-1 were killed by chemical fixation and tested for their ability to support the proliferation of cells that require this growth factor. Only fixed cells expressing human CSF-1 precursors on their surface stimulated the growth in vitro of a murine macrophage cell line or normal mouse bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. The ability of these nonviable fibroblasts to induce the proliferation of CSF-1-dependent cells was not mediated by release of soluble growth factor, required direct contact with the target cells, and was blocked by neutralizing antiserum to CSF-1.

Induction of normal bone marrow colony formation by IL-3 was much less sensitive to TGF-beta 1, and there was little or no effect of TGF-beta 1 on colony formation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). In different clones of myeloid leukemic cells, TGF-beta 1 suppressed differentiation induced with IL-6, IL-1 alpha, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but did not suppress differentiation induced with IL-3 or GM-CSF. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on differentiation of the leukemic cells can be dissociated from its effect on cell growth. TGF-beta 1 suppressed the production of IL-6 in normal bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and the production of IL-6 and GM-CSF in leukemic cells cultured with IL-1 alpha or LPS. The suppression of IL-6 production can explain the suppression by TGF-beta 1 of the effects of IL-1 alpha and LPS that are mediated by IL-6. TGF-beta 1 also suppressed differentiation in clones of myeloid leukemic cells induced with differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and tumor necrosis factor. In different leukemic clones TGF-beta 1 suppressed or enhanced induction of differentiation with dexamethasone. The results show that TGF-beta 1 can selectively control the activity of different molecular regulators of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis."}

We have developed a simple procedure to quantitatively purify Ep from serum and plasma for subsequent testing in the phenylhydrazine-treated mouse spleen cell assay. The method involves absorption of Ep to an immobilized high-affinity anti-Ep monoclonal antibody and acid elution of the antibody-bound material. After neutralization, the eluted EP is then tested directly in the in vitro bioassay without interference by other serum proteins. By using magnetic beads as a solid support for the antibody, washing and elution steps can be performed rapidly and efficiently. Recoveries of Ep after this procedure show very little sample-to-sample variation and are consistently between 45% and 55%, which is close to the maximum binding expected for the anti-Ep antibody. Coupled with the 7.4-fold concentration that this procedure affords, there is an overall increase in sensitivity of three- to fourfold, which makes this assay suitable for accurately measuring Ep levels in patients with below-average titers. Results with this magnetic bead assay indicate that accurate and reproducible estimates for Ep levels in the serum and plasma from healthy donors as well as from patients with hematologic disorders can be obtained. Titers of biologically active Ep in the sera from a group of patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were found to be elevated, and the values correlated well with titers of immunoreactive Ep measured in the Ep radioimmunoassay. Because of its specificity and high sensitivity, the magnetic bead assay is a valuable alternative to immunoassays for the measurement of elevated, normal, and even subnormal Ep levels in human serum and plasma."}

A high concentration of rEp stimulated the formation of mixed erythroid-megakaryocyte colonies (EM colonies) and blast cell colonies, as well as erythroid colonies, erythroid bursts, and megakaryocyte colonies from normal mouse bone marrow cells. Direct effects of rEp on EM colony, megakaryocyte colony, and erythroid burst formation were confirmed by depletion of accessory cells such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages from crude bone marrow cells, and inhibition of the colonies by the addition of rabbit anti-rEp antibody to the culture in a dose-dependent fashion. Replating experiments were performed to confirm the differentiating ability of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of rEp. Most of the blast cell colonies yielded not only secondary erythroid colonies but also megakaryocyte colonies in the presence of 2 IU/mL rEp. Some of the blast cell colonies produced secondary EM colonies in the presence of 16 IU/ml rEp of 2 IU/mL rEp plus interleukin-3, although no granulocyte-macrophage colonies were found in the secondary culture.

In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates. With normal platelets, the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1,600 seconds-1. Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE. EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets. The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface. These data indicate that, under flow conditions, the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen. Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets). The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets. These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients. Furthermore, they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa. The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients."}

While in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) the depressed natural killer function could be restored after a 7-day incubation with recombinant interleukin (IL-2), B-CLL mononuclear cells showed a reduced LAK activity compared with normal LAK cells. Furthermore, in all but 1 of the 20 B-CLL samples tested the leukemic cells were totally resistant to autologous LAK effectors. In most cases the leukemic cells were also resistant to normal allogeneic LAK cells. Competition experiments demonstrated that the patients' LAK cells, as well as normal LAK effectors, were capable of recognizing B-CLL cells, pointing, therefore, to a postbinding cytolytic defect. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) an overall reduced LAK activity against allogeneic targets was documented, but, at variance from B-CLL, hairy cells were often susceptible to the lytic effect of normal LAK cells, and in half of the cases tested the neoplastic population was also sensitive in an autologous system. Similarly to B-CLL, in the great majority of T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders studied, the pathologic cells were resistant to normal and autologous LAK effectors and a defective LAK generation was found. These results demonstrate that in most B and T chronic leukemias the LAK function is defective and, when inducible, does not appear directed against the leukemic population. The possibility of exploiting an immunotherapeutic approach with IL-2/LAK cells in the management of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders does not gain support by these findings."}

B-CLL LAK cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity than did normal LAK cells. When normal LAK cells were grown in B-CLL serum instead of NHS, their proliferation increased; NK cell levels also increased to those found in B-CLL LAK cells, suggesting that B-CLL serum contains a factor that promotes NK cell-like growth, LAK cells derived from normal or B-CLL patients demonstrated similar lytic activity toward K562 and Raji cells. Growth in B-CLL serum did not reduce their lytic potential. Thus, the altered phenotype and growth exhibited by B-CLL LAK cells and normal LAK cells grown in B-CLL serum does not lead to abnormalities in their cytolytic functions. We propose instead that the predominance of NK-like cells in B-CLL LAK cell populations and the presence of an NK cell-like growth factor in B-CLL serum reflect abnormalities related to NK cell-mediated B-cell regulation; ie, either inhibition of normal B-cell growth and/or growth stimulation of the leukemic clone in B-CLL."}

The Bmax values for TCII receptors on proliferating K562 and HL-60 cells were 4,500 and 2,700 per cell, respectively. Corresponding dissociation constants (kd) were 8.0 x 10(-11) mol/L and 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Rabbit TCII also bound to K562 and HL-60 cells but with slightly reduced affinities. Calcium was required for the binding of transcobalamin II to K562 cells. Brief treatment of these cells with trypsin resulted in almost total loss of surface binding activity. After removal of trypsin, surface receptors for TCII slowly reappeared, reaching pretrypsin treatment densities only after 24 hours. Reappearance of receptors was blocked by cycloheximide. TCII receptor densities on K562 and HL-60 cells correlated inversely with the concentration of cobalamin in the culture medium. This suggests that intracellular stores of cobalamin may affect the expression of transcobalamin receptors. Nonproliferating stationary-phase K562 cells had low TCII receptor densities (less than 1,200 receptors/cell). However, the density of TCII receptors increased substantially when cells were subcultured in fresh medium. Up-regulation of receptor expression coincided with increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, which preceded the resumption of cellular proliferation as measured by cell density. In the presence of cytosine arabinoside, which induces erythroid differentiation, K562 cells down-regulated expression of TCII receptors. When HL-60 cells were subcultured in fresh medium containing dimethysulfoxide to induce granulocytic differentiation, the up-regulation of TCII receptors was suppressed. This event occurred well before a diminution of 3H-thymidine incorporation and cessation of proliferation. Thus, changes in the regulation of expression of TCII receptors correlate with both the proliferative and differentiation status of cells."}

However, 4 of 14 patients (28.6%) had rearrangement of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Therefore, centrocytic lymphomas are genotypically distinguishable from the majority of other small cleaved FCC lymphomas by their lack of demonstrable bcl-2 rearrangements.

We now report that incubation of PMN with C albicans for 3 hours was sufficient for detection of TNF release, and peak induction was observed at 8 to 18 hours. This release was inhibitable by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, as well as by emetine and cycloheximide, which block protein synthesis. The TNF produced by PMN was neutralized by specific monoclonal antibodies against human TNF. These results represent an important finding that TNF production is a normal response of PMN to stimulation by fungi such as C albicans and suggest that the release of TNF may be related to autocrine activation of PMN effector function to control Candida growth."}

Plasma volume in the graft and in blood product transfusions was uncorrelated with changes in hemagglutinin titers and therefore was excluded as a significant source of antibody. Removal of graft lymphocytes by CCE did not result in prolongation of host-derived hemagglutinins in recipients of major ABO-mismatched grafts. However, CCE resulted in a complete abrogation of the adoptive transfer of donor-derived antibody as detected in recipients of minor ABO-mismatched grafts. Despite the absence of adoptively transferred donor immunity in recipients of CCE grafts, they had hemagglutinin levels comparable with those of recipients of nonCCE grafts by 6 months after transplantation. This demonstrates that recipients of elutriated marrow were competent to mount de novo responses at that time.

This enhanced survival was independent of the susceptibility of each recipient strain to accept BALB/c BM.

Analysis of chimerism in surviving animals 2 months post-BMT showed that recipient NK depletion significantly increased the level of donor engraftment when high doses of BM were transplanted. These studies also demonstrated that anti-ASGM1 pretreatment mainly resulted in an increase in extramedullary hematopoiesis in the second and third week after irradiation. Anti-ASGM1 treatment also dramatically accelerated the rate of appearance of donor-derived cells with a higher level of donor-cell engraftment apparent at a time when the differences in survival between NK-depleted and control BMT recipients became significant. Peripheral cell counts were also affected by NK depletion, with significantly enhanced platelet and red blood cell recovery and a moderate increase in granulocyte recovery. The overall favorable influence of anti-ASGM1 recipient treatment on hematopoietic events post-BMT suggests that, in humans, pretransplant regimens aimed toward NK depletion should be evaluated."}

The rate of alloimmunization in this group appears to be an explicit function of the number of transfusions received because it increases exponentially with increasing numbers of transfusions. Alloimmunization usually occurred with less than 15 transfusions, although the rate of alloimmunization continued to increase when more transfusions were given. The rate of alloimmunization was less in patients with hemoglobin SC disease and sickle-beta+ thalassemia because these patients had received fewer transfusions. Children less than 10 years old had a slightly lower rate of alloimmunization than patients in other age groups even after correction for the number of transfusions given. Women were more frequently alloimmunized than men; this was largely due to the fact that women received more transfusions than men, but in the age group 16 to 20 years the increase may have been due in part to alloimmunization owing to pregnancy. Forty-five percent of those alloimmunized made antibodies of only one specificity; 17% made four or more antibodies reacting with different antigens. Antibodies to the C and E antigens of the Rh group, the Kell antigen, and the Lewis antigens were most commonly made. These findings may be important in formulating a rational transfusion policy in sickle cell disease."}

In the present study, severe lung vascular leakage was reproduced by application of a leukoagglutinating antibody of anti-5b specificity in an ex vivo lung model. The antibody originated from a multiparous donor-plasma, observed to cause noncardiogenic edema during transfusion therapy. Heated full plasma (anti-5b-titer 1/128) or purified immunoglobulin G fraction was used for the studies. Ex vivo isolated rabbit lungs were perfused with albumin buffer, and human granulocytes (PMN) were admixed to the recirculating perfusate. In presence of anti-5b antibody plus 5b-positive PMN plus rabbit plasma as complement-source, severe lung edema occurred after a latent period of 3 to 6 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure was only transiently and moderately increased, and the leakage reaction could be traced back to a several-fold increase in lung vascular permeability. In contrast, no vascular leakage was noted in lungs perfused in the absence of anti-5b antibody, PMN, or rabbit plasma. Moreover, no permeability increase occurred on use of 5b-negative PMN. This reproduction of TRALI in an ex vivo lung model corroborates the role of leukoagglutinating antibodies in initiating PMN-dependent respiratory distress and suggests a contribution of concomitant complement activation."}

Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been correlated with leukemic cell lineage, the degree of cell differentiation, and the specific gene involved at the molecular level. Many cytogenetic findings have prognostic significance; however, the adverse influence of certain changes, including most chromosomal translocations, may in fact be offset by the greater cytoreductive effects of intensified therapy. Table 4 summarizes the relation of selected karyotypic findings to treatment outcome in patients treated on contemporary protocols. Among all of the chromosomal abnormalities identified in childhood ALL, hyperdiploidy greater than 50 has been associated with the most favorable prognosis. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the treatment outcome for patients with classical Ph+ or hypodiploid ALL is very poor even in programs of intensive chemotherapy; alternative treatment such as bone marrow transplantation should be considered for such patients. Cases with the t(4;11)(q21;q23) also have a very poor clinical outcome, but the adverse prognosis may be limited to the infant or adolescent age groups. The prognostic significance of other nonrandom translocations, such as t(1;19)(q23;p13) and several other abnormalities, needs to be further assessed in larger numbers of patients. Finally, as more is learned about the molecular pathology underlying these rearrangements, it may be possible to develop new therapeutic agents that are specifically targeted to interfere with the aberrant gene products expressed by human leukemic cells."}

Minimal criteria for improvement or progression were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement rates were 43% for skin disease, 35% for evaluable liver disease and 50% for evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 44% of patients. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify patient, disease or treatment factors associated with likelihood of overall improvement and likelihood of response in at least one organ. A similar analysis was also carried out to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of secondary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). In all three models, GVHD prophylaxis using cyclosporine combined with methotrexate was associated with favorable GVHD treatment outcome compared to prophylaxis with either agent alone, and treatment with glucocorticoids or cyclosporine was more successful than treatment with ATG. Other factors associated with unfavorable outcome in the model of time to treatment failure and also entered in one of the response models were recipient HLA disparity with the donor, presence of a liver complication other than GVHD, and early onset of GVHD. Results of this analysis indicate that glucocorticoids represent the best initial therapy available for treatment of acute GVHD, although much room for improvement remains."}

Using two sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, we document in the present study that the production of the two cytokines by AML blasts in culture is coordinated. First, we observe a striking correlation between the levels of GM-CSF and IL-1 beta released by the cells. Thus, a high production of IL-1 beta is always concordant with a high production of GM-CSF and, conversely, low production of IL-1 beta is concordant with low levels of GM-CSF. Second, neutralization of intrinsic IL-1 using antibodies that are specific for IL-1 alpha and -1 beta suppresses the release of GM-CSF by the cells. Third, neutralization of the endogenous source of IL-1 also results in an abrogation of GM-CSF mRNA. Fourth, the production of both IL-1 beta and GM-CSF is up-regulated by exposing AML blasts to an exogenous source of IL-1, suggesting a positive regulation of autocrine growth factor production. Taken together, our results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is mediated by endogenously produced IL-1. Both IL-1 beta and -1 alpha are produced by AML blasts, although IL-1 beta appears to be more abundant. Spontaneous colony formation by AML blasts is abrogated by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, whereas each antibody alone has little effect on blast proliferation. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that the production of IL-1 beta by AML blasts supports autocrine growth in culture, through induction of CSFs or other cytokines that stimulate blast proliferation."}

Zidovudine concentrations sufficient for complete inhibition of HIV replication did not affect rIL-3 induced monocyte proliferation.

Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively.

There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased. The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged. Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment. Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with normal marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3. No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with MDS who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts increased significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3. While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, platelet counts increased by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function. Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors. It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells."}

Washed platelets were incubated with alpha-thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, or ionophore A23187 for increasing lengths of time.

Immunoglold staining performed using standard transmission or scanning electron microscopy high-lighted surface areas devoid of bound antibody. However, a quantitatively normal immunofluorescence was restored if paraformaldehyde-fixed, thrombin-stimulated platelets were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) before MoAb addition, while immunogold staining was now seen to be concentrated within the interior of the platelet. Glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were then embedded in the resin Lowicryl K4M (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd, Aldermaston, England) and immunogold staining performed on thin sections using a polyclonal antibody to glycocalicin.

As assessed by an immunologic assay specific for human PAI-1, guanidine HCI activated HT1080 PAI-1 and rPAI-1 entered the total plasma volume following intravenous bolus administration and exhibited a biphasic clearance pattern. The t1/2s of HT1080 PAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 6.0 and 24.8 minutes, respectively. The t1/2s of rPAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 8.8 and 34.0 minutes, respectively. Similar results were obtained by measuring PAI-1 activity in plasma and with trace amounts of 125I-rPAI-1, suggesting that the above pharmacokinetic behavior could also apply to endogenous PAI-1. The liver was the main site of rPAI-1 clearance. Unactivated, latent PAI-1 exhibited a very different pharmacokinetic profile. Over 80% of latent rPAI-1 cleared from the circulation within 10 minutes (t1/2 = 1.7 minutes). The difference in clearance behavior between activated and latent PAI-1 may be related to the ability of activated PAI-1, but not latent PAI-1, to rapidly form high-molecular-weight complexes with plasma binding factors which were observed in vitro and in vivo. Because PAI-1 could potentially tilt the fibrinolytic balance toward a prothrombotic state, its rapid clearance may represent an important control mechanism governing the circulating levels of this key component of the fibrinolytic pathway."}

Immunoprecipitation of the cell-free translation mixture with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AT-III showed, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a 47-Kd polypeptide which is the non-glycosylated mature form of plasma AT-III. Densitometric scanning showed that this polypeptide constitutes greater than 90% of the radiolabeled polypeptides produced in this system. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography resulted in the elution of cell-free derived AT-III as a broad peak between 0.2 and 0.7 mol/L NaCl. The cell-free derived AT-III also reacted with human alpha-thrombin. In 2 minutes approximately 20% of the AT-III was found associated with a higher molecular weight species, consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric covalent complex between alpha-thrombin and AT-III. Unfractionated heparin accelerated the rate of formation of such complexes. When Ser394 was mutated to Leu to form the AT-III Denver mutant, the cell-free translation product of this mutation did not show any significant complex formation when reacted with alpha-thrombin. A truncated form of AT-III (Met251-Lys432), containing only the putative thrombin-binding domain, was synthesized independently. This 21-Kd polypeptide did not bind heparin; however, it was cleaved by alpha-thrombin presumably at the reactive center Arg393-Ser394. When Ser394 was mutated to Leu the cell-free translation product of this truncated AT-III mutation did not react with alpha-thrombin at the reactive center. This simple cell-free approach, along with site-directed mutagenesis, should allow for the rapid and accurate mapping of the functional domains of human AT-III."}

As compared with normal factor IX (IXN), IXHW contained the same amount of gamma-carboxy glutamic acid but twice the amount of beta-OH aspartic acid. Both IXHW and IXN contained no detectable free -SH groups. Further, IXHW could be readily cleaved to yield a factor IXa-like molecule by factor Xla/Ca2+.

Infusion of thromboplastin into the rabbit caused a rapid increase of radioactivity over the lungs, possibly due to the accumulation of 125I fibrin in the lungs, followed by a rapid decline of radioactivity, suggestive of removal of fibrin from the lungs. Thromboplastin also caused a rapid decrease of systemic fibrinogen that was accompanied by a lengthening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. The effect of coinfusion of rLACI with thromboplastin or bolus injection of rLACI before thromboplastin infusion was studied. At a high dose of rLACI (800 micrograms/kg body weight), the thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase in the lungs and the systemic fibrinogen decrease were completely suppressed. The activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time of the plasma samples lengthened, possibly due to the presence of thromboplastin in circulation. The thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase over the lungs was not completely suppressed by lower doses of rLACI (135 to 270 micrograms/kg body weight), but these doses of rLACI prevented systemic fibrinogen decrease. At a bolus dose of 23 micrograms/kg body weight, rLACI provided 50% protection of the fibrinogen consumption (fibrinogen decreased to 82% compared with 65% in rabbits treated with thromboplastin alone). These results show that rLACI is effective in the inhibition of thromboplastin-induced coagulation in vivo."}

When added together to platelets, these antibodies prevent adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, despite normal fibrinogen binding (Newman et al, Blood 69:668, 1987). To explore the cellular requirements of aggregation after fibrinogen binding, we used several techniques to study platelets treated with Tab and AP3, then stimulated with ADP. We used scanning and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate platelet morphology, immunolabel-surface replication to determine whether individual GPIIb-IIIa complexes clustered, immunocytochemistry on frozen thin sections to study the subcellular distribution of the integrin GPIIb-IIIa and fibrinogen, and biochemical methods to assess the activation of the platelet cytoskeleton. We found that the treated cells had short, blunted projections instead of normal filopodia. Other morphologic abnormalities, apparent in thin section, were aberrantly placed alpha-granules and microtubules, and a prominent, worm-like, fibrinogen-filled surface-connected canalicular system. Biochemical analysis suggested that such platelets undergo massive actomyosin-controlled membrane flow, which serves to sequester GPIIb-IIIa and makes the platelets refractory to aggregation. We conclude that aggregation requires the formation of long, slender filopodia, probably directed by cytoskeletal rearrangements after activation, and that the transmembrane GPIIb-IIIa complex may play a role in signaling these events."}

Samples were collected before (baseline) and twice during the rhGM-CSF administration. The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes remained relatively constant during the first period, but experienced a significant increase (P less than .001) during the second period. The increase was most prominent in the B cells (P less than .001), but the T cells (P less than .016) also increased. Detailed investigation of lymphocyte subsets showed an increase of the markers CD38 (Leu17), HLA-DR, and the transferrin receptor throughout the treatment course giving evidence of lymphoid cell activation. The NK cell activity was suppressed (P less than .008) throughout the treatment. However, proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, Candida antigen, and tetanus toxoid were unaffected. Although the mechanism is not yet defined, GM-CSF does induce activation and increase in absolute lymphoid cell number, especially B cells, together with a decrease in NK cytotoxicity. The implication of these immune cell changes in relation to host resistance to microorganisms remains to be established."}

These eight patients had trisomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. On central morphologic review, five cases were classified as subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia, one as acute mixed lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, one as acute lymphoid leukemia, and one as acute undifferentiated leukemia. Blasts of all eight cases expressed one or more myeloid differentiation antigens. Three also expressed T-lineage-associated antigens; however, none of these had rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta, gamma, or delta genes. Four of six cases tested were TdT positive. All eight patients with trisomy 13 were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy; only three entered a short-lived complete remission. Survival of patients with trisomy 13 ranged from 0.5 to 14.7 months, and was significantly shorter than that of the remaining patients (median 9.5 v 16.2 months, P = .007). We conclude that trisomy 13 is a rare, recurring clonal chromosome abnormality in acute leukemia associated with a poor prognosis. Malignant transformation of an immature hematopoietic precursor cell is suggested by the expression of antigens characteristic of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, the high incidence of TdT positivity, and the morphologic heterogeneity in these leukemias."}

Many of the relevant antigens and most of the relevant enzyme histochemical activities are destroyed and others are less than optimally preserved in tissues embedded in hot paraffin. Most enzymatic activities and antigens are well preserved in tissues embedded at 4 degrees C in glycol methacrylate (GMA). The measurement of DNA content in neoplastic cells with the most commonly employed techniques depended on the availability of fresh suspensions of cells until the development by Hedley of methods that permit the recovery of nuclei from paraffin blocks for this purpose. In order to facilitate the analysis of antigens, enzymatic markers, and DNA from the same sample of tissue, we have developed a means of recovery of nuclei from GMA-embedded tissues. Twenty-microns-thick sections of GMA-embedded tonsil were either pretreated with an organic solvent (absolute ethanol or 2-ethoxyethanol) followed by rehydration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or directly rehydrated in PBS. The suspensions were formed mechanically by gentle sonication. The type of fixative and length of PBS rehydration were varied. Tissue fixed in 100% acetone, embedded in GMA, and rehydrated directly in PBS for six days gave the highest average yield of nuclei, 3.7 x 10(7) nuclei per gram tissue. In order to assess DNA binding of fluorescent dyes, 2-microns-thick GMA sections were stained with chromomycin, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO), and propidium iodide.

The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions."}

Total (cell-associated and secreted) cytokine synthesis was measured. In the strict absence of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), rC5a resulted in a small but statistically insignificant increase in immunoreactive IL-1 beta and TNF, as well as in IL-1 and IL-6 bioactivity. On the other hand, rC5a induced marked transcriptional activation of IL-1 beta and TNF in a dose-dependent fashion with an optimal concentration of 50 ng/mL. The rC5a-induced cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) was not spontaneously translated into protein. At 50 ng/mL, rC5a induced the same levels of mRNA for IL-1 beta and TNF as 1 ng/mL of LPS, whereas LPS induced 12 times more IL-1 beta protein and 70 times more TNF protein than rC5a alone. The C5a-induced mRNA half-life was the same as that induced by LPS. Formyl-Meth-Leu-Phe (fMLP) did not induce cytokine transcription. Pretreatment with rC5a enhanced cytokine synthesis induced by other stimuli. After 2 hours of preincubation with rC5a, PBMC synthesized 3 to 10 times more IL-1 beta and TNF on subsequent stimulation by LPS or IL-1 itself. We conclude that rC5a provides primarily a transcriptional but not translational signal for IL-1 beta and TNF; the half-life of the untranslated mRNA is the same as that of translated message; rC5a-induced transcription upregulates PBMC for enhanced synthesis of these cytokines; and a translational signal can be provided by LPS or IL-1 itself."}

It is unclear if PMN functional heterogeneity is secondary to maturational differences or due to distinct subpopulations of cells that possess different functional capacities. The PMN 31D8 antigen is a useful probe for evaluation of PMN subpopulations. The majority of PMNs (approximately 85%) exhibit a high intensity fluorescence after 31D8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labeling (31D8 enriched or \"bright\" PMNs) as determined by flow cytometric analysis. These cells are more functional than cells with low intensity fluorescence (31D8 diminished or \"dull\" PMNs). Various immunologic, clonogenic and functional techniques were used to study the expression of the 31D8 antigen in HL-60 cells and myeloid cells in order to evaluate antigenic and functional heterogeneity during morphologic maturation. The results of this study indicate that the percentage of 31D8 antigen positive (31D8 antigen enriched and diminished) bone marrow cells increases from 20 +/- 11% in myeloblast cells to 68 +/- 10% in promyelocytes, 93 +/- 2% in myelocytes and 99 +/- 1% in bands and PMNs. 31D8 antigen enriched cells first appear at the myelocyte stage (32 +/- 10%) and increase in bands (52 +/- 13%), marrow PMNs (62 +/- 13%) and peripheral blood PMNs (88 +/- 4%). These data indicate that the heterogeneous expression of 31D8 antigen in PMNs is due, at least in part, to maturational differences within the PMN population and raise the possibility that other heterogeneously expressed PMN characteristics are also maturationally derived. They also suggest that 31D8 antigenic expression may be a more precise indicator of myeloid functional maturation than maturation as identified by cellular morphology."}

In the majority of patients, except for those who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, the number of circulating CD20+ B cell normalized by the fourth posttransplant month. The earliest detectable B cells normally expressed HLA-DR, CD19, surface immunoglobulin (slg), CD21, Leu-8, and lacked expression of CD10 (CALLA). In addition, the circulating B cells expressed CD1c, CD38, CD5, and CD23 for the first year following transplant, antigens that are normally expressed on a small percentage of circulating B cells in normal adults, but highly expressed on cord blood B cells. Similar to cord blood B cells, patient B cells isolated during the first year following transplant, proliferated normally to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC), and produced IgM, but minimal or no IgG when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen and SAC, unlike normal adult B cells that produce both. The similar phenotype and function of posttransplant and cord blood B cells, and their similar rate of decline in patients and normal children adds further evidence to support the hypothesis that B-cell differentiation posttransplant is recapitulating normal B-cell ontogeny."}

The first investigation took place during a period of relative economic stability for the shipyard and the second during the phase of its closure. SETTING--An age cohort health screening programme in Malmo, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--715 Male shipyard workers and 261 age matched male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in 19 variables related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and psychological variables, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary habits as assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS--Serum cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean 0.25 (SD 0.68) mmol/l v 0.08 (0.66) mmol/l) and serum calcium concentrations decreased less (-0.06 (0.10) mmol/l v -0.08 (0.09) mmol/l) in the shipyard workers than in the controls. A correlation was found between scores for sleep disturbance and changes in serum cholesterol concentration. In the whole series there was a greater increase in serum cholesterol concentrations among men threatened with unemployment (437/976; 44.8%) than among those who were not. In stepwise regression analysis the change in serum cholesterol concentration was correlated with changes in haemoglobin concentration, body weight, and serum triglyceride and calcium concentrations. A positive correlation was found between change in cholesterol concentration and change in blood pressure, indicating that the overall risk profile had worsened among men with increased serum cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS--Risk of unemployment increases the serum cholesterol concentration in middle aged men, the increase being more pronounced in those with sleep disturbance. The increase in serum cholesterol is related to changes in other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These findings might partly explain the excessive mortality due to cardiovascular disease recorded among the unemployed and people with sleep disturbance."}

Parasites did not clear by day 7 in primigravidas in six (20%) of 30 who received chloroquine, three (8%) of 35 treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, and none of 23 treated with chlorproguanil and dapsone. At day 28, 83%, 19%, and 67% of primigravidas in these treatment groups were parasitaemic. Haemoglobin concentrations rose in all women, but improvement was sustained only in women who remained free of parasites. CONCLUSIONS--Clearance of parasites was better with either pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine or chlorproguanil and dapsone than with chloroquine. Longest protection was obtained with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine."}

DESIGN--Retrospective review of referrals to 16 consultant orthopaedic surgeons at five hospitals, comprising 288 referral letters with corresponding replies, by scoring contents of letters. SETTING--Orthopaedic teaching hospitals in Nottingham, Derby, and Mansfield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Weighted scores of contents of referral and reply letters, assessment of their educational value, and responses to questions in referral letters. RESULTS--Median outpatient delay was 23.4 weeks. There was no significant decrease in waiting time if the referral letter was marked \"urgent\" but a significantly greater delay (p less than 0.01) if referrals were directed to an unnamed consultant. The content score was generally unsatisfactory for both referrals and replies, and there was no correlation for the content scores of the referral letter and its reply (r = 0.13). Items of education were rare in the referral letters (8/288; 3%) and significantly more common in replies (75/288; 26%) (p much less than 0.001). Senior registrars were significantly more likely to attempt education than other writers (p less than 0.02). Education in replies was significantly related to increased length of the letter (p less than 0.05) and was more likely to occur if the referral was addressed to a named consultant (p less than 0.03). 48 (17%) Referral letters asked questions, of which 21 (44%) received a reply. No factor was found to influence the asking of or replying to questions. CONCLUSIONS--The potential for useful communication in the referral letter and in the reply from orthopaedic surgeons is being missed at a number of levels. The content is often poor, the level of mutual education is low, and the use of the referral letter to determine urgency is deficient. Most questions asked by general practitioners are not answered."}

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING--General practices in inner London and Devon. SUBJECTS--859 General practitioners, 609 (71%) of whom returned the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of rectal examinations done each month; the indication score, derived from answers to a question asking whether the respondent would do a rectal examination for various symptoms; and the confidence score, which indicated the respondent's confidence in the diagnosis made on rectal examination. RESULTS--279 General practitioners did five or fewer rectal examinations each month and 96 did more than 10 each month. Factors significantly associated with doing fewer rectal examinations were a small partnership and being a female general practitioner, and the expectation that the examination would be repeated. Lack of time in the surgery, and a waiting time of less than two weeks for an urgent outpatient appointment were also important. General practitioners were deterred from doing rectal examinations by reluctance of the patient (278), the expectation that the examination would be repeated (141), and lack of time (123) or a chaperone (39). Confidence in diagnosis was significantly associated with doing more rectal examinations, the perception of having been well taught to do a rectal examination at medical school, and being a male general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS--Factors other than clinical judgment influence the frequency of rectal examination in general practice. Rectal examination may become commoner with the trend towards larger group practices and if diagnostic confidence is increased and greater emphasis put on rectal examination in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching."}

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of reproductive history and risk behaviour of women positive for HIV antibody and prediction of detection by screening on the basis of blood group samples, Guthrie tests, and rubella tests. SETTING--City of Dundee, where the prevalence of HIV is high, since the appearance of HIV in 1984, predominantly among heterosexual intravenous drug users. PATIENTS--All (61) women known to be positive for HIV antibody who had had clinically indicated tests, for whom case notes were available for 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Risk assessment according to case notes and reported to the laboratory, incidence of infection, geographical location, age, date of positive test result, and reproductive history. RESULTS--With 61 infected women the overall minimum prevalence among women within the city of Dundee was 0.67/1000 and 2.9/1000 among women in their third decade. Of the 60 women whose reproductive history was available, 35 had 57 pregnancies, 36 of which occurred after seroconversion was known to have taken place, representing 8.7% of the total number of affected pregnancies reported for the United Kingdom. If antenatal screening for HIV had been performed between 1984 and 1989 it could not have detected positivity for HIV antibody in 25 (42%) women who had no pregnancies during this time. Among the remaining 35 women, screening samples taken for blood grouping could have identified a maximum of 34 (57%), samples taken to check rubella susceptibility a maximum of 22 (37%), and blood spots on Guthrie cards a maximum of 19 (32%). Retesting would have occurred in 14 women 33 times with samples taken for blood grouping, but three and four women would have been tested twice using samples taken for rubella testing and Guthrie cards respectively. Anonymous screening would have been unable to determine risk category as a history of intravenous drug use was known in 47 (79%) women before testing but this was increased by a further 5 (8%) who admitted to it after the test result was known. CONCLUSION--Interpreting the results of antenatal screening programmes will be complex and will underestimate overall prevalence of HIV antibody among women; this will be exaggerated by strategies based on anonymous testing with Guthrie cards or on samples taken for rubella testing, which do not include women who have had an earlier loss of pregnancy. Only open testing with consent will permit satisfactory attribution to"}

SETTING--1 District general hospital. PARTICIPANTS--About 40 consultant physicians, senior registrars, and junior staff dealing with 140 inpatient records.

RESULTS--A significant overall increase in median scores for questions on record keeping occurred after the start of the audit (p less than 0.01), but interobserver variation was high. The parallel audit meetings on clinical management proved to be more successful than the general audits in auditing medical care and were also considered to be more useful by junior staff. CONCLUSIONS AND ACTION--Medical audit apparently resulted in appreciable improvements in aspects of care such as clerking and record keeping. Analysis of the scores of the general audits has led to the introduction of agreed standards that can be objectively measured and are being used in a further audit, and from the results of the audits of clinical management have been developed explicit guidelines, which are being further developed for criterion based audit."}

RESULTS--Hospital switchboards responded within 30 seconds in 87 (74%) calls, and in 76 calls (64%) the duty doctor requested was contacted within a further two minutes. Chest pain, possibly due to myocardial infarction, was the most common reason for acute medical admissions. Nearly half (48%) of the duty doctors in larger hospitals reported having 4-5 hours sleep or less on their nights on call. Most (30) were on a one in three rota; two were on a one in two rota.

Transplantation was performed in 33 of the diabetic patients, whose mean age was lower than that of those who did not receive a transplant (41 v 48 respectively, p less than 0.05). Comparison between the 42 diabetic patients and matched controls showed that the overall survival at five years was 46% and 77% respectively. The three year survival of the diabetic patients who did not receive a transplant was poor (41% v 79% respectively). Of patients transplanted, survival at five years was 73% in the diabetic patients and 90% in the controls. However, there was no significant difference in the five year graft survival (64% v 46% respectively). CONCLUSIONS--Diabetes adversely affects morbidity and mortality in patients having renal replacement treatment, but renal transplantation seems to be the best option for treating diabetic patients with end stage renal failure."}

DESIGN--Retrospective comparison of cases and matched controls. SETTING--Renal unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, providing both dialysis and renal transplantation. PATIENTS--82 Diabetic patients starting renal replacement treatment between 1979 and 1988, compared with 82 matched non-diabetic controls with renal failure and 39 different matched controls undergoing renal transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient characteristics, history of smoking, prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial ischaemia at start of renal replacement treatment; survival of patients with renal replacement treatment and of patients and allografts with renal transplantation. RESULTS--The overall survival of the diabetic patients during the treatment was 83%, 59%, and 50% at one, three, and five years. Survival was significantly poorer in the diabetic patients than the controls (p less than 0.001). Particularly adverse features for outcome at the start of treatment were increasing age (p less than 0.01) and current cigarette smoking (relative risk (95% confidence interval) 2.28 (0.93 to 4.84), p less than 0.05). Deaths were mainly from cardiac and vascular causes. The incidence of peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was the same in diabetic patients and controls (49% in each group remained free of peritonitis after one year), and the survival of renal allografts was not significantly worse in diabetic patients (p less than 0.5). CONCLUSIONS--Renal replacement treatment may give good results in diabetic patients, although the outlook remains less favourable than for non-diabetic patients because of coexistent, progressive vascular disease, which is more severe in older patients."}

The duration of ischaemia ranged from 15 to 365 min but was longer in those who underwent ex vivo surgery (149 to 365 min). Of the 21 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy or enucleation, the serum creatinine level increased (greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl) post-operatively in 16 patients, of whom 9 required temporary haemodialysis. No recurrence has been noted in those who underwent partial nephrectomy, but 1 patient who underwent enucleation of the tumour developed a solitary pancreatic metastasis 2 years 6 months after surgery and was treated by a partial pancreatectomy. Kidney-preserving surgical procedures are considered to improve the quality of life, but careful follow-up is necessary."}

Four distinct diseases can be identified through immunofluorescent staining, indicating that each is the result of different responses of the urothelium and endothelium to injury.

We assessed mast cell counts in bladder biopsies from 27 women with idiopathic sensory urgency and 10 control patients about to undergo a colposuspension procedure for pure genuine stress incontinence; 30% of the study group had a clear increase in the detrusor muscle mast cell population (detrusor mastocytosis).

The mean catheterised residual volume was 98.53 ml for patients with acute retention and 14.48 ml for patients with long-term catheters. The explanation for higher post-catheterisation volumes in the acute retention group is probably multifactorial; bladder sacculation and diverticula, detrusor tone and reflux may all play a role."}

In this study, Ki67 antibody was used to determine the proportions of cells undergoing active division in 26 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. The proportion of cells stained in muscle invasive tumours (12.3 +/- 5.4%) was significantly greater than in superficial tumours (4.3 +/- 1.9%) and poorly differentiated tumours showed significantly greater proportions of cells staining compared with well or moderately well differentiated tumours. These results show that Ki67 reactivity correlates with high tumour stage and poor differentiation. Ki67 staining provides an easy method of determining tumour cell turnover that might provide additional prognostic information."}

A screening peak urinary flow rate of 12 ml/s or less was associated with urodynamic evidence of obstruction in 95% of cases; 35% of patients with symptoms of outflow obstruction and a flow rate greater than 12 ml/s were also found to be obstructed. One year post-operatively, 84% of patients who were selected for surgery on combined symptomatic and urodynamic criteria were pleased symptomatically with their result. The failure of detrusor instability to resolve following prostatectomy was associated with symptomatic failure of treatment. Residual obstruction was demonstrated in 5 patients who had undergone prostatectomy and were asymptomatic at this time. This study illustrates that objective measures are necessary in the assessment of patients prior to prostatectomy in order to select only patients who are obstructed. The importance of a screening flow rate is emphasised. All patients who underwent surgery had cystometric evidence of obstruction but the symptomatic results of surgery were no better than the results in patients who had been assessed according to non-urodynamic selection criteria. We have thus failed to identify a need for routine cystometry in the pre-operative assessment of these patients. Cystometry does, however, have a role in assessing patients with pre-operative flow rates greater than 12 ml/s and in those who remain symptomatic following prostatectomy."}

A \"control\" series of patients (n = 40) in whom the primary diagnosis was benign were also reviewed and their course followed (group 2). The heterogeneity of the abnormalities in group 1 was striking. Of the 44 cases, pre-malignant lesions were seen in 8, microinvasive adenocarcinoma in 11 and lesions not now considered pre-malignant in the remaining 25. None of the 8 patients with pre-malignant lesions developed clinical evidence of carcinoma over a follow-up period of 8 to 12 years. In contrast, 3 of the 11 diagnosed on review as having microscopic invasive adenocarcinoma developed clinically evident tumour within 5 years of surgery. Of the 25 patients whose prostatic lesions were considered benign, 2 developed carcinoma 12 and 13 years after surgery. Only 1 of the 40 patients in group 2 had a pre-malignant lesion and he did not develop tumour within 10 years. However, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed incidentally in 1 patient 3 years after surgery. It was concluded that there is a need to standardise interpretation and reporting of pre-malignant lesions and microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma in the prostate. The limited results on the course of pre-malignant lesions diagnosed incidentally in patients over 60 years of age do not indicate that follow-up would have prompted the early diagnosis of invasive disease."}

Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head. Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass. Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour. Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels. No vascular encasement was seen. Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP. The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis. PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women. Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis."}

A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery."}

The results show that the CA72-4 assay is significantly better at separating stage I and II disease from normal controls (P less than 0.01) than CEA (n.s.) or CA19-9 (n.s.). CA72-4 also gave better differentiation between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.01) and between those who were serosa positive and negative (P less than 0.01).

Long-term results were very good in 85 per cent of the 177 patients and in 82 per cent of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. The results of this series suggest that a one-stage procedure can be safely performed with some technical precautions in most patients operated on electively for diverticular disease, even if an extracolic abscess is found.

Detailed results for 103 patients (limb salvage rate 60 per cent, amputation rate 35 per cent, mortality rate 5 per cent) were similar to those of previously published reports. Complications in most series were infrequent, but in the entire survey there were six bleeding-related deaths and one death from anaphylaxis. A total of 67 per cent of surgeons with working experience indicated that selected patients with acute arterial thromboses were most suitable for thrombolysis, particularly if there was no neurological deficit and no run-off for surgical bypass. Distal or late emboli and graft occlusions were regarded as appropriate by some surgeons. This study demonstrated that many vascular surgeons currently use thrombolysis, although sparingly and in selected cases. Patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by experienced vascular surgeons who are aware of the new therapeutic alternatives, an ideal supported by almost three-quarters of respondents to this survey."}

From these we determined the changes in vein diameter occurring during the operative procedures, in response to induction of anaesthesia, and after completion of surgery. Veins showed no evidence of dilatation in response to the induction of anaesthesia, but by the end of the operative procedure showed distension of 22-28 per cent. Distension was most prominent in the gastrocnemius veins, and lesser distension was observed in the posterior tibial veins. In a series of patients who received an infusion of 1 litre of saline in addition to basal requirements, distension was 57 per cent compared with 22 per cent in the corresponding control group.

The importance of the spleen in host defence against malaria and other infections makes splenic preservation desirable whenever possible after rupture of the spleen. Tropical splenomegaly is caused by an abnormal immune response to malaria and is best managed medically. Careful selection of blood donors is essential to prevent transfusion malaria, and routine antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for blood recipients in many endemic areas. The risk of postoperative malaria may justify chemoprophylaxis in certain patients."}

Since that time, over 400 patients have undergone PPPD with approximately 41 per cent having chronic pancreatitis and 54 per cent having pancreatic and other periampullary malignancies. Reported 5-year survivals in this latter group have been comparable to those achieved by the classic Whipple procedure. The postoperative mortality rate in 339 reported patients has been 3.8 per cent. Postoperative morbidity, including delayed gastric emptying, has been similar to that of the classic Whipple operation. However, PPPD has been associated with fewer late problems with dumping, diarrhoea, delayed gastric emptying (8.6 per cent), and marginal ulceration (3.6 per cent). Moreover, most patients undergoing PPPD have been able to return to their preoperative and preillness weight. The additional advantage of decreased operative time makes PPPD an attractive alternative to the classic pancreatoduodenectomy."}

In 105 (78 per cent), a primary hepatic neoplasm was histologically confirmed, and 47 patients (45 per cent) proved to have primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-nine orthotopic liver transplants were performed in 28 of these patients (27 per cent). Twenty patients (71 per cent) survived 30 days or longer (median 11.5 months; range 2-87 months), of whom nine are currently alive. We retrospectively analysed our data to determine the influence of preoperative evaluation, histological type and staging on outcome. Computed tomography proved to be superior to intraoperative assessment (86 versus 58 per cent) in diagnosing tumour positive nodes. Patients with tumour negative lymphadenopathy had a better prognosis. Postoperative stage I/II had a median survival of 16 months (range 3-87 months) compared with 7.5 months (range 2-20 months) for stage III. Non-cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had the best prognosis; cholangiocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients with hepatocelluar carcinoma had the worst outcome with no survivors beyond 1 year. Because of the advanced stage of disease at the time of presentation, the value of liver transplantation in primary liver cancer is limited. For those presenting with advanced disease confined to the liver (stage I/II) in whom conventional hepatic resection is not possible, significant benefit can be achieved in selected cases."}

To investigate the effectiveness of mucosal intussusception in preventing ascending cholangitis, 20 mongrel dogs were randomized to undergo Roux-en-Y cholecystjejunostomy and common bile duct ligation with or without mucosal intussusception. Aeromonas hydrophila was instilled into the gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial cultures were grown from samples taken from the gallbladders and lower jejunum, and blood chemistry and barium studies were performed. The barium studies showed satisfactory lack of reflux in all ten dogs with mucosal intussusception. Only two of them had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder 3 days after bacterial instillation into the jejunum. All ten dogs in the control group had positive cultures for Aeromonas from the gallbladder. Our results showed that the mucosal intussusception group had a significantly lower rate of recovery of organisms from the gallbladder compared with the control group when the organisms were instilled into distal intestine (P less than 0.05).

The action of these opioids on the sphincter of Oddi was evaluated by means of intraoperative manometry in 36 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. Both opioids were given in intravenous cumulative equipotent doses up to a maximum of 10 micrograms/kg morphine or 100 micrograms/kg pethidine. At these doses, morphine increased the mean(s.d.) frequency of contractions from 2.4(1.0) to 7.9(1.6) (P less than 0.001); this effect was reduced by naloxone (0.04 mg bolus, P less than 0.05). Pethidine inhibited the frequency of contractions from 1.5(0.8) to 0.8(0.5) (P less than 0.05); this response was blocked by atropine (0.6 mg bolus, P less than 0.01). Pretreatment with atropine or naloxone reduced the frequency of contractions significantly (P less than 0.05). The results illustrate different responses to pethidine and morphine of the sphincter of Oddi, and provide a pharmacological explanation for the suitability of pethidine over morphine as the analgesic of choice in patients experiencing biliary pain."}

Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used to treat postoperative inflammation, but their effect on the maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis is unknown. Forty-six patients admitted for elective cataract surgery were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups and received 1% prednisolone acetate, 1% indomethacin or artificial tears four times before surgery, in addition to standardized preoperative dilating drops and intraoperative epinephrine. Pupillary diameter was measured and the time interval noted five times during the surgery. During surgery the indomethacin group lost significantly less mydriasis than the control group. The mydriasis losses of the prednisolone acetate group were between those of the indomethacin and control groups, but these differences did not reach significance. We conclude that prednisolone acetate is less effective than indomethacin for maintaining mydriasis during cataract surgery."}

We surveyed 268 physicians from three geographic regions in North American with different specialties and responsibilities for HIV-positive patients. An important difference was found between the published risk and the physicians' perceived risk of infection after a single occupational exposure. Almost half of the respondents stated that they feared contracting AIDS more than other diseases. The physicians who perceived themselves to be at high physical risk were more likely than the others to report that AIDS had changed the way they interact with their patients (r = 0.26, p less than 0.001). No relation was found between the perception of physical risk and the number of HIV-infected patients (r = -0.07, p = 0.15). However, the perception of social risk showed a small inverse correlation (r = -0.15, p less than 0.02), in which the physicians with more HIV-infected patients reported less concern about negative social consequences. The physicians who perceived themselves to be at high personal risk were more likely than the others to report that surgeons have the right to refuse patients who do not wish to undergo HIV antibody testing (r = -0.16, p less than 0.01 for physical risk; r = -0.29, p less than 0.001 for social risk). Multiple regression analyses indicated that physicians' perception of physical risk was not related to age or sex but was modestly related to income source. The perception of social risk was related to sex and income source. Physicians' perception of personal risk is a crucial, yet often unacknowledged, component of the fight against AIDS. Our findings suggest that lack of attention to this issue is seriously compromising initiatives designed to facilitate physician participation in AIDS care."}

These guidelines must be developed from a synthesis of existing scientific data ideally obtained from randomized clinical trials. However, at present we may have to rely on less satisfactory data and the views of experts in the field. The primary purpose of these initiatives must be to improve patient care. The Ontario Medical Association has made recommendations on how such guidelines should be produced, and in a recent survey a substantial majority of family physicians supported them. There is general agreement that the coordinating body should be independent of government and other interested parties. In addition, the medical profession must have the primary role, and a number of medical organizations should also be represented. We propose a possible structure for a group charged with developing guidelines for medical practice at a provincial level and on an experimental basis. Recommendations are made on its membership, function and relationship with other organizations. The identification and diffusion of justifiable, scientific practice patterns will help reduce waste of scarce resources, maintain the role of the profession as guardian of the quality of care and ultimately benefit the patient."}

A search of three computer databases for articles published from January 1980 to May 1989 and of the bibliographies of articles located revealed 10 reports, involving 990 subjects, that met the following inclusion criteria: original research, published in English or French since 1950, sample of at least 25 patients, inclusion of only patients over 60 years, mean follow-up period of 1 year or more and description of the patients' mental state during follow-up. The methods and study designs were then assessed with the use of the criteria for prognostic studies established by McMaster University Health Sciences Centre, Hamilton, Ont. All of the studies had serious, multiple flaws. Nevertheless, when the results were combined it appeared that at least 60% of the patients remained well or had relapses with recovery (mean follow-up 31.9 months); up to 25% remained continuously ill. Physical illness, cognitive impairment and severe depressive symptoms were frequently related to poor prognosis; most of the social factors studied were not related to prognosis. Future studies must pay attention to methods and design, particularly the composition of study populations, the assessment of outcomes and the control of extraneous prognostic factors."}

The erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits in all of the patients. The serum ferritin level was elevated in 12. The xylose absorption test results were abnormal in 8 of the 13 patients able to complete the study. None of the duodenal aspirates yielded a pathogen. Light microscopy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation without infection in the stomach (in seven patients), the esophagus (in five), the duodenum (in two) and the rectum (in two). However, biopsy specimens were positive for Candida albicans in the esophagus (four patients), cytomegalovirus in the esophagus (one) and the rectum (two), Helicobacter pylori in the antrum (two), Treponema infection in the rectum (two) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in the small intestine (one). Only three patients had a normal series of biopsy specimens. All of the patients had similar ultrastructural changes at the epithelial-stromal junction of the antral glands and in the intestinal crypts. We conclude that abnormal biochemical and endoscopic findings are common in HIV-positive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Defects in carbohydrate absorption and ultrastructural changes may be responsible for some aspects of HIV enteropathy."}

All of the infants were fed formula fortified with iron (13 mg/L) for at least 6 months, starting at 2 months of age. The plasma ferritin level decreased after the formula was no longer used. Although 90% of the infants were given cereal fortified with iron (30 mg of iron per 100 g) by 9 months of age, the plasma ferritin level continued to decrease. The level was less than 10 micrograms/L in 54% of the infants at 12 months of age and in 74% at 15 months; this indicated depleted iron stores.

They were asked their reason for attending the clinic, their perception of the urgency of their problem, their choices as alternatives to walk-in clinics and their satisfaction and concerns with the type of care received at the clinic. The three most common reasons for attending the clinic were convenient location (in 33% of the cases), inability to see their regular physician soon enough (in 16%) and no appointment needed (in 13%). Most (80%) of the patients felt that they needed medical attention within 24 hours after the onset of their problem. Most (83%) of the respondents would have sought medical attention at another walk-in clinic, from their regular physician or at an emergency department had the clinic been closed. Only 36% and 18% of the patients respectively responded that their regular physician worked evenings or weekends. Most of the visits to the clinic were outside regular weekday business hours. The level of satisfaction with the service received at the clinic was high. The extended hours and no-appointment philosophy of walk-in clinics, coupled with family physicians' reluctance to work evenings and weekends, have made such clinics an attractive option for patients with primary care problems that they believe require prompt attention."}

Evidence is now abundant to show that gastrin stimulates the growth of both gastric and colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and that blockade of gastrin receptors can prolong survival in xenografted nude mice. We have thus performed a randomized, controlled study of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor antagonist proglumide as therapy in 110 patients with gastric carcinoma. Proglumide had no overall effect on survival (Mantel-Cox statistic = 0.5, P = 0.48). The 95% confidence interval for the proglumide treated group was 260 to 474 days compared to 230 to 372 days for the control group. No significant difference was seen with proglumide, which has a relatively low affinity with the gastrin receptor and also has partial agonist activity. Drugs that are far more specific and potent gastrin receptor antagonists are becoming available, which may have a greater effect on survival, and further clinical trials of such compounds are clearly indicated to determine the efficacy of hormonal control of gastrointestinal malignancy."}

There were 48 men and 18 women with a median age of 55 years (range, 18 to 75 years) and Karnofsky performance status of 80 (range, 40 to 90). Primary site was nasopharynx (28 patients), followed by larynx (12) and others (26). Forty-one (62%) patients were presented with Stage IV disease. The response rate to induction chemotherapy was 27% complete response, 50% partial response, 20% stable disease, and 3% progressive disease. There was no significant difference in response rate between patients with cancer of nasopharynx or other sites (P greater than 0.1). Survival was 61% at 24 months. Patients with cancer of nasopharynx had a better survival than those with other primaries (P = 0.033). Toxicities from chemotherapy included alopecia (73%), nausea/vomiting (66%), leukopenia (54%), stomatitis (36%), anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (16%), and diarrhea (9%). Grade IV toxicity was not observed. Induction chemotherapy with this new regimen resulted in a high response rate but may not be superior to cisplatin and FU alone. It can be safely combined with radiotherapy as a potentially curative therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

For the patients who did not undergo mastectomy, the 5-year actuarial risk for appearance of a primary was 17% in the irradiated group versus 57% in the nonirradiated group (P = 0.06).

This method was prospectively applied to 100 mammographically detected breast lesions in 100 women (mean age, 53 years). All 100 patients underwent surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions after cytologic aspiration. Sufficient aspirated material was obtained for cytologic diagnosis from 91 patients (91%). The histologic and cytologic interpretations were then compared. Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology (12 invasive ductal carcinoma, six ductal carcinoma in situ, and two lobular carcinoma in situ), of which 17 had been cytologically diagnosed. There were no false-positive diagnoses of malignancy by FNAB. False-negative readings (3.3%) included two cases of lobular carcinoma in situ and one case of ductal carcinoma in situ. This technique thus demonstrated a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and overall diagnostic accuracy of 96.7% for the nonsurgical detection of malignancy in nonpalpable breast lesions. These results suggest that the established safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of FNAB can be maintained in this clinical setting. This procedure may obviate the need for open surgical biopsy in those patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of malignancy. It can also be done using standard techniques and equipment available in many community hospitals."}

Consistent with the results of immunostaining, the TA-4 concentrations in SCC tissues of the lung, esophagus, and normal squamous epithelia were much higher than in those of lung cancer other than SCC, benign pulmonary diseases, normal lung, and submandibular gland tissues. The TA-4 concentration in SCC tissue tended to increase with increasing grades of differentiation.

In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern.

This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms."}

This type of CPDN has all the features of the conventional type of CPDN; however, in addition, there are grossly demonstrable papillonodular projections extending from the septa into the cyst lumina. The septa do not show any expansile tumor masses. Like most cases of the conventional type, this new type of CPDN was usually diagnosed in infants. Nephrectomy (total in 10 and partial in 1) was done in these cases. Additional chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy was given in seven cases. No recurrence was noted during the period extending from 21 months to 8 years in the eight cases in which follow-up data are available. Nephrectomy with regular follow-up visits for possible recurrence may be the management of choice. Pathologists should be aware of this variant of CPDN so that overtreatment can be avoided. The revised criteria for CPDN can be summarized as follows: (1) The discrete entirely cystic tumor contains luminal papillonodules in some cases. (2) Septa and the papillonodules, when present, are the only solid portion of the tumor and contain blastemal cells admixed with their normal and aberrant derivatives. (3) The tumor without and with papillonodules is classified as a conventional and papillonodular type of CPDN, respectively."}

In addition, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical survey of 23 cases and an electron microscopic examination of three. The findings were compared with observations of 32 cases of de novo malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). All tumors contained additional distinct anaplastic portions indistinguishable from MFH under conventional light microscopy, ultrastructurally, and in cases of immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin and on lectin histochemical findings for ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin agglutinin. The desmin reactivity present in anaplastic portions of 14 DSTS and in eight de novo MFH is taken to mean that myofibroblasts are present in these tumors. The anaplastic components of DSTS are presumed to represent the proliferation of another clone of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that fail to differentiate along any specific lineage other than fibroblast-like cells, histiocyte-like cells, and myofibroblasts. Nineteen patients died of tumor and four are alive and well 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, and 5.2 years after the initial treatment, respectively."}

The authors therefore analyzed long-term survival in 378 patients, entered in three randomized trials, started between 1973 and 1978. Combined data from the three trials were used to increase the power for identifying prognostic variables. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 7382 randomized patients to oophorectomy plus either cyclophosphamide or combination chemotherapy or observation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2174 randomized patients who had not progressed 3 months after oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy or observation. Trial ECOG 2177 randomized estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER-unknown patients to oophorectomy plus combination chemotherapy or immediate combination chemotherapy, and ER-negative patients were directly assigned to combination chemotherapy. Hence ER-negative patients need not have been healthy enough to be randomized to oophorectomy. With only 14% of the patients still alive, median survival on the three studies was 30, 24, and 28 months. The median survival of individual treatments changed noticeably in ECOG 2174 and ECOG 2177 with long-term follow-up. At this time there are no differences in survival between randomized regimens in any of the three trials. In a multivariate model, factors associated with significantly poorer survival were visceral-dominant disease, nodal metastases, breast metastases, age younger than 45 years, ER negativity, and not receiving chemotherapy immediately after oophorectomy. This treatment difference was thus not due to imbalances in the prognostic variables used in the model, but it may be due to imbalances of unknown prognostic factors or differences in patient selection."}

Patients who consumed halva before treatment were significantly more likely to increase their ratings for foods consumed after chemotherapy than patients who consumed familiar cookies. Aversions to the novel food were significantly more frequent than aversions to the familiar food. These findings provide evidence that a novel but not a familiar food consumed before chemotherapy can act as a scapegoat to prevent items in the regular diet consumed after chemotherapy from decreasing in preference. Providing patients with a novel food before chemotherapy is a useful clinical intervention to reduce the likelihood of forming aversions to familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy."}

In 449 cases, results of progesterone receptor assay by ICA using the monoclonal anti-PgR antibody KD 68, also correlated significantly with biochemical PgR measurements. The ERICA/PgRICA positivity was significantly more frequent in postmenopausal white women. Colloid carcinomas were most likely to be ERICA positive and PgRICA positive whereas medullary carcinomas were most often negative. In 47 patients with advanced mammary carcinoma, results of ERICA and PgRICA were more closely related to endocrine response than those of ER and PgR by dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCC). In 339 women with Stage I or Stage II breast cancer, ERICA was significantly associated with disease-free survival. Analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model, however, showed PgRICA to be the best predictor of survival and disease-free survival in 197 women at the same stages of disease. These data indicate that ICA is more predictive of prognosis than biochemical ER and PgR. The ease of ICA performance coupled with these results indicate that the method is an acceptable substitute for DCC in analyzing breast cancers for ER/PgR."}

Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10).

This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered."}

When analyzed analogously to previous work, the results confirmed a dose-response relationship: that is, there appeared to be an improved disease-free survival for patients receiving higher doses of adjuvant chemotherapy. The major criticism of such an analysis is its bias. This bias was addressed by considering only patients who were still receiving therapy at 6, 12, and 24 months; then, the dose-response relationship was no longer seen.

Because data from the literature did not unequivocally support the local superiority of IA infusion, a comparative study was started in 1986. Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of 45 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on days 1 and 2; 12 g/m2 of high-dose methotrexate on days 15 and 22; and 3 g/m2 of ifosfamide on days 29, 30, 50, and 51 followed on days 31 and 52 by intravenous (IV) versus IA tourniquet infusion of cisplatin (DDP). A strict randomization of patients was not feasible. A balanced distribution of risk factors was strived for by stratifying and allocating the appropriate patients centrally. The infusion time was prolonged from 1 to 5 hours in the IV group, and the DDP dose was reduced from 150 to 120 mg/m2 in both arms when intolerable ototoxicity became apparent. A multivariate analysis was performed to exclude a bias on the response rates from risk factor distribution and from modifications of DDP infusion time and dosage. The overall fraction of histologic good responders (greater than 90% necrosis) was not found to be different after IA versus IV treatment (34/50 [68%] vs. 41/59 [69%]). Intraarterial instead of IV use of DDP within an aggressive systemic treatment does not seem to improve the local tumor response."}

A classification based on the number of invaded subsites was proposed, which agreed well with the T classification of the TNM system. Cancers originating from the hypopharynx invaded more subsites than cancers from the endolarynx, and among the latter, supraglottic were more invasive than glottic lesions. The number of invaded subsites was strongly associated with nodal involvement. Among symptoms at onset of disease and at diagnosis, patients with endolaryngeal lesions reported dysphonia and dyspnea more frequently, and patients with lesions from other regions had a higher prevalence of dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, and adenopathia. Clinical and epidemiologic results of this study suggest considering the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx as separate anatomic entities. Diagnostic delay was not associated with tumor size and showed a negative trend with involvement of cervical lymph nodes, suggesting that stage at diagnosis is due to intrinsic differences in tumor aggressiveness."}

However, expression of this antigen has also been detected in embryonal carcinomas, in nonembryonal carcinomas, in malignant melanomas, and even in some myeloid cell lines and macrophages at late stages of differentiation. In this study, using monoclonal antibody Ki-1, expression of CD30 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in frozen sections of 28 benign and 63 malignant mesenchymal tumors. The authors found CD30 expressed in two of four leiomyomas, seven of 11 leiomysarcomas, one of six rhabdomyosarcomas, two of two aggressive fibromatoses, one of three fibrosarcomas, two of four synovial sarcomas, one giant cell tumors of tendon sheaths, all five malignant fibrous histiocytomas, all three osteosarcomas, one of three Ewing's sarcomas, in a tumor cell subpopulation of two of ten malignant schwannomas, and in the Schwann cell compartment of one of two ganglioneuromas tested. Furthermore, CD30 was consistently expressed in the myoepithelial compartment of 13 fibroadenomas. However, all five lipomas, all seven liposarcomas, all three neuroblastomas, both ganglioneuroblastomas, both chondrosarcomas, and tumors of disputed origin tested were consistently CD30 negative. These findings indicate that, outside the lymphatic system, CD30 antigen is not restricted to epithelial neoplasms but may also be present in tumors of mesenchymal origin. The authors conclude that CD30 antigen, although having limited utility in the differential diagnosis of tumors of questionable histogenesis, may eventually define relevant subgroups within the main tumor categories."}

Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25.

Two cases of Hodgkin's disease showed no rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes. All 42 cases of B-cell lymphoma had Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement with or without additional rearrangement of the light chains (C kappa and C lambda). One case of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had additional T-cell receptor beta-chain (C beta) rearrangement. Sixteen of 18 cases of T-cell lymphoma had C beta rearrangement, and one case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma had additional JH rearrangement. Two of eight (25%) cases of follicular lymphoma but only one of the 34 (2.9%) cases of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had bcl-2 rearrangement that was detected by pFL-1 probe. None of the 62 cases showed bcl-2 rearrangement using the pFL-2 probe. In conclusion, the Ig and TCR gene rearrangement pattern of the lymphomas found in Hong Kong correlates well with the T-cell and B-cell lineage, which is similar to reports in the white population. However, the incidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular B-cell lymphoma is lower than that reported in the US but comparable with that in Japan."}

An anomalous expression of Lewis a antigen was found in 88 of 249 gastric biopsy specimens of Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients. The prevalence of this anomaly increased with the evolution of the premalignant process, in agreement with the commonly accepted model of gastric carcinogenesis. Thus, anomalous Lewis a antigen appeared in 66.6% of gastric dysplasia cases, in 64.6% of intestinal metaplasia, in 15.4% of atrophic gastritis, and in 7.4% of superficial gastritis. No alterations were found in subjects with normal gastric mucosa. Forty-seven of the 49 Lewis (a-b+) phenotype gastric carcinoma patients showed antigenic alterations in tumor cells (anomalous Lewis a antigen in 36 and loss of Lewis antigens in 11). In 26 of these gastric specimens an anomalous Lewis a antigen was present in areas of intestinal metaplasia and/or dysplasia away from the area of neoplastic transformation. The expression of Lewis a antigen in Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients is a frequent phenomenon in gastric neoplastic cells and could result from the blocked synthesis of Lewis b antigen with accumulation of its precursors. These findings suggest that, during gastric carcinogenesis, antigenic alterations may precede neoplastic transformation. An anomalous Lewis a antigen could constitute a significant index of severity of the histologic lesion and contribute to identifying high-risk individuals."}

Of the 55 tumors successfully analyzed, 22 (40%) were diploid and 33 (60%) were aneuploid. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of all 55 samples was 6.17%. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients with diploid and those with aneuploid tumors (48% versus 42%). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant survival difference between aneuploid and diploid tumors within any one histologic subgroup. There was also no significant survival difference related to the DNA index. The results indicate that the extent of local tumor spread is still the most important prognostic factor for patients treated with radiotherapy for NPC. The data support the conclusion that patients with lymphoepithelioma and anaplastic carcinomas have a superior survival to patients with squamous cell carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

The neoplasm developed within the submandibular gland of a 78-year-old woman with invasion of the mandible and metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Histopathologically, cuboidal cells possessing clear cytoplasm and displaced round nuclei proliferated and exhibited an adenomatous pattern. Many cystic spaces surrounded by tumor cell strands were seen, mucus substance filled in the cystic spaces, and the tumor cells seemed mucus-secreting, but neither epidermoid cells nor papillary appearance could be observed. Electromicroscopically, numerous mucous droplets of low electron density were prominent in the cytoplasm, and the tumor cells had sparse irregular microvilli on the luminal surface. Mucin histochemistry, including paradoxical concanavalin A staining, revealed that the tumor cells contained neutral and acid mucins, and these were identified as class II and III mucosubstances. No other neoplastic lesion, except recurrent metastatic neck nodes, has been detected 6 years after the first examination, and it seems that the tumor is a rare primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the submandibular gland."}

Quality control studies on reproducibility, tissue heterogeneity, and analysis procedures have been included. Of the 197 patients studied, aneuploidy was found in 102 (52%); the median %S value was 8% with a range of 0.4% to 38%. Our results demonstrated that number of positive nodes, receptor status, and grade were of prognostic value. Cell cycle kinetic data were not of independent prognostic value in this series. However, ploidy could differentiate in prognosis in the receptor-negative subgroup. Patients with receptor-negative tumors had a significantly better overall survival if the tumor was diploid in nature. Cell kinetics was not significantly prognostic for either receptor subgroup, although patients with higher %S tended to have better relapse-free and overall survival. This is in disagreement with other studies and may demonstrate that treatment has confounded our results and diminished the ability of flow cytometry data to help predict outcome."}

Only in six of 23 samples cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma did the immunocytochemical typing of cytokeratins (ICTC) confirm the cytologic diagnosis. In seven cases some of the tumor cells stained positively with antibody Ks B.17 specific for simple epithelial keratin (No: 18), suggesting the presence of some cells of glandular origin. In ten additional cases the ICTC was in conflict with the cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., antibodies Ks 8.12 and KK 8.60 were negative, and antibody Ks B.17, positive) supporting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. In 14 of 18 cases cytologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, the ICTC confirmed the diagnosis whereas in four cases additional presence of some squamous cells was noticed. The ICTC labeling of cases cytologically diagnosed as undifferentiated and large cell carcinomas was similar to that of the group of adenocarcinomas. Thus, the application of cytokeratin typing for TFNAB samples seems to provide a vital complementation to routine cytologic study, especially for cases cytologically diagnosed as squamous carcinoma."}

The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24).

The results of this statistical analysis show that in 72% of the cases (31 of 43) this probability ratio exceeded 1. Because the probability that two independent tumors will have a near-identical aneuploid DNA content is very low, this finding supports a metastatic process rather than the occurrence of multiple primary tumors in these patients.

Catheters inserted in femoral arteries were used to arteriographically locate and size 36 systemic arteries in 9 lambs weighing 4.2 to 7.4 kg. Twenty-four vessels were embolized prior to heparinization with 400 u/kg heparin, IV. Effective anticoagulation was demonstrated by post-heparin activated clotting time (ACT) values greater than 300 sec. Seven vessels (29%) were not successfully coil-embolized because of inadequate coil position or distant embolization of the coil; 17 (71%) of these vessels were shown to be successfully occluded by arteriography 6 to 77 min later. After a period of systemic heparinization ranging from 71 to 159 min, 9/17 arteries remained occluded, 7/17 could not be examined arteriographically due to early demise of the animal, and only 1/17 showed recanalization. A second group of 12 vessels were embolized after heparinization. Eight (75%) were successfully occluded, and 4 (25%) were not successfully coil-embolized because of inadequate coil position or coil embolization to distant arteries. We conclude that systemic heparinization had no measurable effect on occlusion rates in coil-embolized systemic arteries in the lamb.

In 26 patients with aortic stenosis and simultaneous recordings of ascending aortic and femoral arterial pressure we compared this method with a simplified approach in which the peripheral arterial pressure is partially aligned by advancing it against the left ventricular pressure by 50% of the time delay of the simultaneously recorded upstrokes. Gradients measured this way predicted the true aortic valve gradients (left ventricular-ascending aortic) with a mean difference of +1.1 mm Hg (range = +10 to -5 mm Hg).

In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation."}

The arterial pressure decreased after sufentanil (P less than 0.05), reaching a nadir (mean 108/65 mmHg, heart rate 63 bpm) at one minute post-incision. Clinically important hypertension or hypotension did not occur in any patient. One patient, receiving beta-blocker therapy, required atropine to control bradycardia. Postoperative respiratory depression did not occur in patients who received less than one micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 with the last increment being given more than 20 minutes before the end of anaesthesia.

The duration of analgesia and the occurrence of any symptoms which might be side-effects of the epidural morphine were recorded. The duration of analgesia was 22.9 +/- 10.1 hr and was not correlated with the dose of epidural morphine. Eleven per cent of the patients required no supplemental analgesia during the first 48 hr. Twelve patients (0.25 per cent) had respiratory rates less than 10 breaths per minute, on at least one occasion. No serious sequelae resulted from these periods of bradypnoea. Pruritus occurred in 58 per cent of patients, nausea and vomiting in 39.9 per cent and dizziness in ten per cent. Herpes simplex labialis was recorded in 3.5 per cent of patients.

Part I of this paper describes some of the pathophysiological events leading to ischaemic brain injury. Part 2 of this paper will consider the current agents available for brain protection."}

This was also true in the rat auricle after pertussis toxin treatment. Then, in both tissues, ATP further increased the contraction after a maximal beta-adrenergic stimulation. The increase in contractile force could be related to the increase in the calcium current. The L-type calcium current was measured by whole-cell patch-clamp recording in single cells isolated from the rat ventricle after the sodium and potassium currents were inhibited by tetrodotoxin and cesium, respectively. When added alone, 10 microM ATP increased the calcium current by 60%. Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was also able to increase calcium current. Adenosine was much less effective, and GTP, UTP, CTP, and ITP were without effect. A similar increase in calcium current was observed when ATP was added in addition to a maximal stimulation by a beta-adrenergic agonist or after internal perfusion with cyclic AMP. However, this increase was preceded by a transient decrease whose origin could not be attributed to a P1-purinergic agonistic effect of ATP. The transient decrease was not elicited by adenosine or in a magnesium-free HEPES solution and was not suppressed after pertussis toxin treatment. This effect appeared related to the variations in the holding current also observed upon ATP application. Together with vasodilation, ATP and adenine compounds induced positive inotropy. The latter effect could be attributed in part to the increase in calcium current and was independent of cyclic AMP. Both effects are complementary with the beta-adrenergic stimulation and can help healthy cells to compensate the failing zone from which ATP could be released."}

Characterization of receptors present on submucosal arterioles has not been carried out, because these vessels have not been accessible to study by previous methods. We have used a novel optical method for on-line tracking of outside diameter from in vitro preparations of submucosal arterioles in the ileum and colon of guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans to characterize the vasoconstrictor responses to vasopressin as well as other vasopressor agents along the gastrointestinal tract. All ileal submucosal arterioles showed smoothly graded constrictor responses, whereas colonic arterioles from each species exhibited rhythmic vasoconstrictions. Vasopressin constricted guinea pig and human submucosal arterioles (EC50, 1 nM) by activating classical V1 receptors; dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) for the V1 antagonist d(CH2)5 Tyr (Me) arginine vasopressin were 1-3 nM. This antagonist was 10-50-fold more potent in inhibiting vasopressin constrictions in rabbit submucosal arterioles (Kd = 0.05-0.1 nM). No evidence for the presence of V2 receptors was obtained in any arteriole, and no significant differences in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constrictions were observed in these vessels. Results from this study suggest the presence of heterogeneity of V1 receptors in submucosal arterioles; these differences appear to be species dependent. Our results also suggest that intrinsic vasoconstrictor properties of submucosal arterioles differ along the length of the gastrointestinal tract; these differences appear to be species independent."}

It is unclear, however, which mechanisms mediate this effect. In view of the significance attached to endothelial injury in the initial phases of atherogenesis, we decided to test whether sympathetic activation might lead to an increase in endothelial injury. Chloralose anesthesia was used to induce sympathetic activation and the presence of intracellular IgG as a criterion of endothelial cell injury. The beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol was used to evaluate if the effect(s) of sympathetic activation might be mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. In normal rabbits, the frequency of injured endothelial cells in unbranched areas of the thoracic aorta was 0.23%, compared with 1.93% in circumostial areas. Chloralose anesthesia caused significant increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine, that is, caused sympathetic activation, and led to an approximately fivefold increase in the number of injured cells both in unbranched and in circumostial areas. This increase was totally inhibited by metoprolol pretreatment, indicating that it was mediated by beta 1-receptors. These observations suggest one possible mechanism that may connect sympathetic activation with atherogenesis and explain why beta-blockade protects against atherosclerosis."}

Complementary DNA probes for rat pro-alpha 2 (I), mouse type III and mouse type IV collagens, and chicken beta-actin were used. Northern and dot blot analysis on total RNA extracted from left ventricular tissue indicated a sixfold increase in steady-state levels of mRNA for collagen type I on day 3 of abdominal aortic banding, which had declined to control levels by day 7 where it remained rather constant at 4 and 8 weeks. Type III collagen showed a similar pattern of gene expression after banding. mRNA levels for type IV collagen, on the other hand, were elevated on day 1 after banding, returning to control at day 7 and remaining constant.

Addition of OZ to the PMN-perfused lungs caused pulmonary vasoconstriction and weight gain; neither OZ nor PMNs added individually to the perfusate altered pulmonary vasomotor tone or wet weight. The steady gain in lung weight by 1,588 +/- 464 mg over the 45-minute study period was associated with pulmonary capillary hypertension and an increase in the capillary filtration coefficient, indicative of increased lung vascular permeability. These responses may not be due to generation of oxygen radicals, because the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics and lung weight were not reduced by addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, or superoxide dismutase plus catalase. We examined the basis of the PMN-mediated effects by layering PMNs on bovine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers. Challenge with OZ resulted in increased endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin. The monoclonal antibody IB4 (directed against CD18, the common beta-subunit of structurally related adhesion receptors on phagocytes, LFA-1, Mac-1, and P150,95) prevented the OZ-mediated increase in PMN adherence to endothelial cells and the increase in endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin. IB4 also inhibited the lung weight gain mediated by the OZ-stimulated PMNs in intact lungs. The protective effect of IB4 could be ascribed neither to inhibition of uptake of OZ by PMNs nor to inhibition of release of oxygen radicals, myeloperoxidase, and elastase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

The recovery of pHi from an equivalent intracellular acidosis was more rapid when the cells were incubated in CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS than in HEPES-buffered PSS. Recovery of pHi was dependent on extracellular Na+ (Km, 13.1 mM); however, it was not attenuated by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), indicating the absence of SITS-sensitive HCO3(-)-dependent mechanisms. Recovery instead appeared mostly dependent on processes sensitive to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), indicating the involvement of Na+/H+ exchange and a previously undescribed EIPA-sensitive Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism. Differentiation between this HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism and Na+/H+ exchange was achieved after depletion of cellular ATP. Under these conditions, the NH4Cl-induced 22Na+ influx rate stimulated by intracellular acidosis was markedly attenuated in HEPES-buffered PSS but not in CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS. EIPA also appeared to inhibit the two mechanisms differentially. In HEPES-buffered PSS containing 20 mM Na+, the EIPA inhibition curve for the intracellular acidosis-induced 22Na+ influx was monophasic (IC50, 39 nM), whereas in an identical CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS, the inhibition curve exhibited biphasic characteristics (IC50, 37.3 nM and 312 microM). Taken together, the results indicate that Na+/H+ exchange and a previously undescribed EIPA-sensitive Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism play an important role in regulating the pHi of human vascular smooth muscle. The involvement of the latter mechanism depends on the severity of the intracellular acidosis, varying from approximately 25% in severe intracellular acidosis up to 50% at lesser, more physiological, levels of induced acidosis."}

The model takes into account the dependence of apparent viscosity of blood on vessel diameter and hematocrit (the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect), the reduction of intravascular hematocrit relative to the inflow hematocrit of a vessel (the Fahraeus effect), and the disproportionate distribution of red blood cells and plasma at arteriolar bifurcations (phase separation). The model was used to simulate flow in three microvascular networks in the rat mesentery with 436,583, and 913 vessel segments, respectively, using experimental data (length, diameter, and topological organization) obtained from the same networks. Measurements of hematocrit and flow direction in all vessel segments of these networks tested the validity of model results. These tests demonstrate that the prediction of parameters for individual vessel segments in large networks exhibits a high degree of uncertainty; for example, the squared coefficient of correlation between predicted and measured hematocrit of single vessel segments ranges only between 0.15 and 0.33. In contrast, the simulation of integrated characteristics of the network hemodynamics, such as the mean segment hematocrit or the distribution of blood flow velocities, is very precise. In addition, the following conclusions were derived from the comparison of predicted and measured values: 1) The low capillary hematocrits found in mesenteric microcirculatory networks as well as their heterogeneity can be explained on the basis of the Fahraeus effect and phase-separation phenomena. 2) The apparent viscosity of blood in vessels of the investigated tissue with diameters less than 15 microns is substantially higher than expected compared with measurements in glass tubes with the same diameter."}

We stimulated the vagus nerves with one brief burst of electrical pulses each cardiac cycle, and we changed the timing of the stimulus by a small, constant amount each cardiac cycle to scan the entire cycle. To vary the heterogeneity of acetylcholine release, we changed the voltage of the stimulus pulses over a range of submaximal values. To achieve the maximum homogeneity of acetylcholine release, we used supramaximal voltages, and we varied the level of acetylcholine release from each excited fiber by changing the number of pulses per burst. We used the average cardiac cycle length of the phase-response curve to assess the overall vagal effect, independent of its timing within the cardiac cycle. We found that the amplitude of the phase-response curve varied directly and the minimum-to-maximum phase difference varied inversely with the overall efficacy of vagal activity. However, for any given alteration in the overall efficacy, the specific changes in the characteristics of the phase-response curve did not depend on whether the alteration was achieved by varying the number of pulses per burst or by varying the stimulus voltage. Therefore, we conclude that although the cardiac chronotropic response is very sensitive to changes in the timing of vagal stimulation, it is not influenced appreciably by the spatial dispersion of acetylcholine release from the vagal nerve endings over a wide range of stimulation strengths."}

In addition to pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics, we measured the plasma-to-lung lymph equilibration rate of [125I] albumin. We followed all the sheep for 10 hours, including a 2-hour baseline period. Dextran was more effective in expanding plasma volume (63 +/- 15% [mean +/- SD]) than saline (11 +/- 6%) at the end of the 30-minute infusion. Pulmonary vascular pressures increased after dextran and remained elevated for 8 hours, whereas after saline the pressures returned to baseline within 1 hour. After dextran, lung lymph flow increased and remained elevated. It was only transiently increased after saline. We confirmed that dextran equilibrated rapidly with lung lymph (half-time, less than 0.6 hour), even though it maintained plasma volume expansion for the whole body (half-time, 11.1 +/- 2.7 hours). The dextran increased both plasma and lymph total macromolecular osmotic pressure but did not increase the plasma-interstitial (lymph) osmotic pressure difference in the lung, except transiently during the infusion. The lymph/plasma protein concentration ratio increased after dextran due mainly to plasma protein dilution. There were no differences in the half-time of tracer albumin equilibration between plasma and lung lymph (control, 2.2 +/- 0.6 hours; saline, 2.0 +/- 0.6 hours; dextran, 2.3 +/- 0.6 hours). Dextran 70 increased liquid filtration mainly by increasing microvascular pressure and possibly filtration surface area. There was no evidence for a change in the leakiness of the lung microvascular barrier to albumin."}

Under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the lung elicited a biphasic response characterized by an initial increase in lobar arterial pressure followed closely by a decrease. The response to nerve stimulation was reproducible with respect to time and was not altered when a delay coil was added to the perfusion circuit, indicating that the response was directly mediated. The increase in pressure was reduced by prazosin and by yohimbine, whereas the decrease in pressure was blocked by propranolol or ICI 118551. These data suggest that the pressor component of the response is mediated by alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas the depressor response is mediated by beta 2-receptors. The pressor response was enhanced by propranolol or ICI 118551, whereas the depressor response was enhanced by prazosin or yohimbine, suggesting that the response to nerve stimulation represents the net effect of the actions of neuronally released norepinephrine on alpha- and beta-receptors. The pressor response to nerve stimulation was enhanced when tone was elevated with a prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue and when beta-receptors were blocked. The effects of an increase in tone and a passive increase in pressure on responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Mean arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and heart rate were comparable in rat groups up to 20 months. During the interval from 20 to 29 months, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreased dP/dt indicated that a significant impairment of ventricular function occurred with senescence. In the period between 4 and 12 months, a reduction of nearly 19% in the total number of myocytes was measured in both ventricles. In the subsequent ages, similar decreases in myocyte cell number were found in the left ventricle, whereas in the right ventricle, the initial loss was fully reversed by 20 months. Moreover, from 20 to 29 months, a 59% increase in the aggregate number of myocytes occurred in the right ventricular myocardium. In the left ventricle, a 3% increment was also seen, but this small change was not statistically significant. These estimations of myocyte cellular hyperplasia, however, were complicated by the fact that cell loss continued to take place with age. The volume fraction of collagen in the tissue, in fact, progressively increased from 8% and 7% at 4 months to 16% and 22% at 29 months in the left and right ventricles, respectively. In conclusion, myocyte cellular hyperplasia tends to regenerate the ventricular mass being lost with age in the adult mammalian rat heart."}

In its most elementary form, this behavior can be mathematically described by E(t) = P(t)/[V(t)-Vd], where E is ventricular elastance, t is time, P is ventricular pressure, V is ventricular volume, and Vd is the intercept of the end-systolic pressure-volume line on the volume axis. To find out how this behavior of the ventricle as a whole is related to the properties of the myocardium, we tested the energetic prediction for the ventricle that the pressure-volume area of an isovolumic contraction equals the energy released in relaxation in experiments on isolated rabbit papillary muscle at 20 degrees C. To that end, the energy (joules) contained by the force-length area of the muscles, contracting isometrically, was compared with the heat (joules) liberated in relaxation as measured with thermopiles. Mechanical performance of the muscles was varied by altering initial muscle length and external calcium. The slope of the resulting relation between force-length area and heat liberated in relaxation (n = 26) was not significantly different from unity. Thus, the energetic prediction of the time-varying elastance model developed for the whole left ventricle was confirmed by experiments on rabbit papillary muscle at 20 degrees C."}

During a continuous infusion of L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine to anesthetized, overnight-fasted dogs, we measured the uptake of radiolabeled phenylalanine from plasma and the release of unlabeled phenylalanine from myocardial proteolysis using arterial and coronary sinus catheterization and analytic methods previously applied to skeletal muscle. Using these measurements, together with a model of myocardial protein synthesis that assumes rapid equilibration of tracer specific activity between myocardial phenylalanyl-tRNA and circulating phenylalanine, we estimated the rates of heart protein synthesis and degradation. The rate of heart protein synthesis was also estimated directly from the incorporation of labeled phenylalanine into tissue protein. The use of [3H]phenylalanine was compared with L-[1-14C]leucine in the measurement of heart protein turnover in dogs given simultaneous infusion of both tracers. Leucine uptake and release by the myocardium exceeded that of phenylalanine by 3.1 +/- 0.4- and 1.7 +/- 0.3-fold, respectively, consistent with leucine's 2.4-fold greater abundance in heart protein and its metabolism via other pathways. Phenylalanine is the preferred tracer for use with this method because of its limited metabolic fate in muscle. One theoretical limitation to the method, slow equilibration of circulating labeled phenylalanine with myocardial phenylalanyl-tRNA, was resolved by comparison of these specific activities after a 30-minute infusion of labeled phenylalanine in the rat. A second, empirical limitation involves precision in the measurement of the small decrements in phenylalanine specific activity that occur with each pass of blood through the coronary circulation. This was addressed by improving the precision of both the measurements of phenylalanine concentration and phenylalanine specific activity using high-performance liquid chromatography. We conclude that the in vivo measurement of phenylalanine tracer exchange across the myocardium permits the nondestructive estimation of heart protein turnover in the intact animal."}

Peak force, sarcomere length, and action potentials were measured in thin ventricular trabeculae. Relevant control conditions were stimulation frequency, 0.2 Hz; [Ca2+]o, 1 mM; [K+]o, 5 mM; [Na+]o, 150 mM. The inotropic interventions and results were as follows. 1) The interventions of high [Ca2+]o, low [Na+]o, high [K+]o, addition of tetraethylammonium chloride, or postextrasystolic potentiation resulted in approximately the same (within 5%) maximum force (Fmax). Above the respective optimum doses, force declined and aftercontractions were often observed. Combinations of the different interventions never enhanced force to above Fmax. This suggests that Fmax is determined by a maximum level of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, above which spontaneous release occurs. 2) Sr2+ (10 mM) caused an increase of force to 1.3 X Fmax and lengthening of contraction and action potentials. The force-sarcomere length relation was, then, similar to that in skinned fibers at maximum activation. Hence, 1.3 X Fmax reflects saturation of the sarcomeres. We postulate that a large influx of Sr2+ during the long action potential can circumvent the reticulum and activate the sarcomeres directly. When the reticulum was blocked with ryanodine, maximum force of tetanic contractions was about 1.1 X Fmax. This result supports the above conclusions. 3) Isoproterenol increased force to a maximum that was 20% below Fmax and shortened the contraction. This may be due to a decreased sensitivity of the sarcomeres to Ca2+ or to stimulation of the Ca2+ pump in the reticulum, that is, an increasing fraction of the released Ca2+ is sequestered before it can activate the sarcomeres. Thus, three factors that limit force production were identified, depending on the inotropic stimulus."}

To test the hypothesis that increased coronary venous pressure leads to an increase in LV wall volume and a decrease in LV diastolic distensibility, we studied excised, blood-perfused LV isovolumic dog hearts without the pericardium. In protocol I (n = 8), to raise coronary venous pressure the pressure of right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) was increased by the height of a blood reservoir connected with a cannula that opened in both the RA and RV. In protocol II (n = 7), to isolate the effect of RV enlargement on LV diastolic distensibility (direct ventricular interaction), an isovolumic RV balloon was used with coronary venous pressure held constant at 0 mm Hg. Changes in LV diastolic distensibility were assessed by shifts of the LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation. Changes in LV wall volume were detected by subepicardial segment length at end-diastole. The mean pressures of RA and RV (protocol I) and RV balloon only (protocol II) were increased from 0 to 15 and 30 mm Hg over a range of LV volume. In protocol I, when RA.RV pressure was increased from 0 to 30 mm Hg at three levels of LV volume (22 +/- 2, 31 +/- 3, and 40 +/- 3 ml), LV end-diastolic pressures increased significantly from 5.2 +/- 0.3 to 11.2 +/- 1.5, from 10.4 +/- 0.3 to 18.2 +/- 1.2, and from 20.2 +/- 1.0 to 28.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, respectively. In protocol II, when RV balloon pressure was increased from 0 to 30 mm Hg at the three LV volumes (21 +/- 3, 31 +/- 3, and 41 +/- 4 ml), LV end-diastolic pressures showed smaller increases from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.2, from 9.8 +/- 0.3 to 11.6 +/- 0.6, and from 19.0 +/- 0.5 to 21.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, respectively. In both protocols, the LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation shifted upward in a nearly parallel fashion, but the shift was much greater in protocol I than in protocol II. Despite constant LV volume, an increase in LV wall dimension in protocol I was significant and much greater than that in protocol II. From these results, we conclude that increased coronary venous pressure decreases LV diastolic distensibility with increasing LV wall volume, and this mechanism appears to act independently of diastolic ventricular interaction caused by RV enlargement."}

The phosphorylatable threonine and serine residues at positions 18 and 19 of the two myosin RLC sequences are conserved. The two cDNAs are 81% homologous at the nucleotide level over the coding region; the 5' and 3' untranslated regions are divergent. Most of the DNA nonhomology in the coding region does not affect the protein sequence, indicating strong evolutionary conservation pressure to maintain the myosin RLC structure. Northern blot analysis using 3' untranslated region probes reveals restrictive tissue specific expression of one myosin RLC isoform (LC20-A) in smooth muscle tissue and not in other tissues examined. In contrast, the novel myosin RLC isoform messenger RNA (mRNA) is uniformly expressed in all smooth and nonmuscle tissues examined and is designated as cellular myosin RLC for this reason.

Hearts from rats with bands placed on the aortic arch at 23 days of age (BAND) and sham-operated rats (SHAM, 8 weeks postoperative) were isolated, perfused with Krebs buffer, and had a left ventricular balloon to measure developed pressure. Hearts were made globally ischemic until they developed peak ischemic contracture and were reperfused for 30 minutes. Additional hearts were perfused for 15 minutes with glucose-free hypoxic buffer followed by 20 minutes of oxygenated perfusion. There was an 87% increase in heart weight of BAND compared with SHAM (p less than 0.01). During ischemia, lactate levels increased faster in BAND compared with SHAM, ischemic contracture occurred earlier in BAND than in SHAM despite no difference in ATP levels, and postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure was less in BAND (26.8 +/- 5.6% of control left ventricular pressure, mean +/- SEM) compared with SHAM (40 +/- 4.6%, p less than 0.05). During hypoxic perfusion, lactate release was greater in BAND than in SHAM (48.8 +/- 1.2 versus 26.6 +/- 0.97 mumols/g, p less than 0.01), and with reoxygenation, lactate dehydrogenase release was less in BAND than in SHAM (13.2 +/- 0.7 versus 19.5 +/- 0.2 IU/g, p less than 0.01). After hypoxia and reoxygenation, left ventricular pressure recovery was greater in BAND than in SHAM (93 +/- 8.4% versus 66 +/- 5.3%, p less than 0.01). Thus, this study suggests that hypertrophied hearts have a greater potential for glycolytic metabolism, resulting in an increased rate of by-product accumulation during ischemia, which may be responsible for the increased susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to ischemic injury."}

Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's EC50 for the negative dromotropic effect by 14-fold in guinea pig heart and 1.6-fold in rat heart. This is consistent with the greater number of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1,231 +/- 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 +/- 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 125I-aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein), rat (11 +/- 0.5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes. Hypoxia increased the rate of adenosine release by severalfold and caused slowing of heart rate and AV block. In spontaneously beating hearts, the main effect of hypoxia was a slowing of ventricular rate, which in the guinea pig heart was due to AV block and in the rat heart to atrial slowing. In atrial paced hearts, hypoxia caused a marked prolongation of AV nodal conduction time in guinea pig (39 +/- 4 msec) and rabbit (29 +/- 5 msec) hearts, but only small effect in rat hearts (10 +/- 2 msec). The differences in response to hypoxia could be accounted for by the species-dependent differences in the 1) amount of adenosine released and metabolized, 2) sensitivity of the hearts to adenosine, and 3) dependency of AV nodal conduction on atrial rate. The findings indicate that the results from physiological or pharmacological studies on adenosine in one species may not be applicable to others, and the ultimate effect of adenosine and hypoxia is to slow ventricular rate."}

Cocultures were stimulated with control buffer, ATP, bradykinin, melittin, A23187, or nitroprusside in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of LNMMA (30-300 microM). LNMMA caused significant, concentration-dependent decreases in cyclic GMP accumulation in response to the endothelium-dependent dilators bradykinin, ATP, melittin, and A23187 but had no effect on control or nitroprusside-stimulated cocultures. The inhibitory effect of LNMMA on cyclic GMP accumulation was partially reversed by treatment with L-arginine, but was unaffected by D-arginine. To determine the specific site of action of LNMMA, endothelial cells on microcarrier beads were placed in a column and superfused with buffer. The effluent from the column was collected in 30-second (1.5-ml) fractions into 2-cm2 monolayer wells of vascular smooth muscle cells before and after addition of agonists (bradykinin, A23187) to the column inflow. The cyclic GMP content of each well of smooth muscle cells was determined as an index of EDRF activity. LNMMA superfused through the endothelial cell column inhibited cyclic GMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells induced by bradykinin and A23187. LNMMA introduced into the effluent from the endothelial cell column had no effect on smooth muscle cyclic GMP levels. We conclude that LNMMA is an effective, specific inhibitor of EDRF production or release, and its action is specific to the endothelial cell."}

These series of experiments evaluated the effects and possible mechanism of action of VIP on the developing canine cardiovascular system. In all three series, measurements of mean heart rate and blood pressure were taken in the control state, after parasympathetic denervation with bilateral cervical vagotomies, and after autonomic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg) and phentolamine (0.5 mg i.v.). In series 1, we characterized the role of alpha-adrenergic receptors in early newborn puppies by investigating the hemodynamic effects of phentolamine alone in five early newborn puppies. In series 2, the hemodynamic effects of intravenous VIP infusion (0.2 microgram/kg/min) were recorded and compared in six early newborn puppies and in 10 late newborn puppies. In series 3, the hemodynamic effects of phentolamine in the presence of VIP receptor binding inhibitor were studied. In early newborn puppies, VIP had essentially no effect on heart rate or blood pressure until phentolamine was given; then, blood pressure decreased by 17% (p less than 0.005). In late newborn puppies, VIP resulted in an increase in heart rate in the control state but not after parasympathetic or sympathetic denervation. In early newborn puppies, phentolamine alone resulted in a 24% decrease (p less than 0.005) in blood pressure, compared with a 54% decrease (p less than 0.005) in early newborn puppies preexposed to VIP infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

On the basis of the present observations on treated and untreated cases, the authors advocate treatment by fixation without realignment, accepting the deformity in moderate and severe chronic slips. Rotational osteotomy may be considered in the event of hip joint contracture."}

The ten knees showed no significant change in stability after knee replacement when the joint line was maintained in its natural position. When the femoral component was repositioned 5 mm proximally and 5 mm anteriorly, a significant increase in laxity occurred during midflexion. When the joint line was shifted 5 mm distal and 5 mm posterior to its anatomic location, significant tightening occurred in midrange of motion. Coupled rotation of the tibia with knee flexion was decreased after surgery in all knees with no specific relationship to joint line position. Coupled rotation with varus-valgus testing, however, remained within the normal range through the first 30 degrees of flexion only when the joint line was restored to its normal anatomic position. Stability in condylar knee arthroplasty is in part dependent on position of the joint line. Surgical techniques that rely on restoring the flexion and extension gap without regard to joint line position may result in alteration of varus-valgus or anterior-posterior displacement in midrange flexion."}

The components were implanted into the medial condyles of 12 preserved human tibiae, and a cyclic load was first applied anteromedially and then posteromedially. The screwed implants failed at significantly higher loads (1634.8 +/- 121.6 N, mean +/- standard error of the mean) than the pegged implants (1103.3 +/- 152.0 N). On application of a 19.6-N preload, the screwed implants moved significantly less than the pegged implants. Although the differences in micromotion and subsidence were not always significant, there were definite trends. The screwed implants had much lower levels of temporary and permanent displacement compared with the pegged implants for all load levels from the initial load of 245.2 N up to and including the failure load. When the motion that resulted from moving the load from the anterior position to the posterior position was examined, the screwed implant's average total motion was less than 10 microns compared with almost 135 microns for the pegged implant after the 245.2-N load cycle. For the cycle before failure, the screwed implant's average motion increased to less than 29 microns, whereas the pegged implant's average total motion was almost 354 microns. From this information it appears clear that screws provide better initial fixation stability than angled pegs for uncemented unicondylar tibial components."}

(1) Ideas and concepts recently proposed were first put forth much earlier. (2) Controversy regarding this ligament continues despite the increased amount of information available. Much of the recent ACL literature, although regarded as newly discovered, has its roots in far older, and apparently forgotten or overlooked, work. Examples include: (1) ACL intactness is best tested at full extension; (2) hemarthrosis and ACL rupture are closely associated; and (3) ACL rupture sometimes masquerades as a minor injury. Additionally, early investigators achieved notable advances in surgical techniques. These contributions disappeared from the literature for two major reasons. First, early investigators observed few patients, with typical practitioners rarely seeing ACL injuries, and consequently, little data existed to support their observations. Second, observations could not be confirmed until the advent of widespread, successful surgery. Undoubtedly, orthopedists now know much more about the ACL, yet many issues remain controversial. Does the ACL perform a vital function? What is the efficacy of operative versus nonoperative treatment? What are the relative merits of direct repair, intraarticular substitutes, and extraarticular nonanatomic procedures? The origins and continued existence of controversy stem from several sources, including the less than rigorous study design and the scarcity of natural history, long-term follow-up studies, and basic science studies. The perception of the ACL as a simple structural unit has also perpetuated this controversy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

In monolayer cultures, the adherent periosteal cells showed fibroblastlike morphology and overtly expressed neither osteogenic nor chondrogenic phenotypes. Cultured cells inoculated heterotopically into nude mice eventually gave rise to bone tissue at the subcutaneous injection site. The process of bone formation occurred through two different mechanisms: intramembranous bone formation at the peripheral portion of the inoculum early and endochondral bone formation in the central portion later. Frozen, preserved periosteal cells also formed bone after introduction into nude mice in the same temporal histologic sequence as the unfrozen cells. Cultured chick muscle fibroblasts from donors that were the same age as controls did not form bone or cartilage when inoculated under identical conditions to those of cultured periosteal cells. These results suggest that periosteum of young chicks contains subsets of progenitor cells that possess the potential to differentiate directly into osteoblasts or chondrocytes when inoculated in vivo. Importantly, this potential is retained after enzymatic isolation, cell culture, subculturing, and freeze preservation."}

However, in children with arthritis it is important to distinguish among those with rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, or hypogammaglobulinemia. Rheumatoid factor is specific for adult-type rheumatoid arthritis; the presence of antinuclear antibodies increases the likelihood that the child may develop uveitis; and hypogammaglobulinemia may be associated with complicating infections. Other unusual antibodies, autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complexes, and complement activation products are found in children with arthritis, but none of these define a diagnostic or consistent group of diseases. Similarly, changes in the numbers of immunologically active cells and regulating mechanisms occur but not in specific patterns. As yet, none of the known immunologic abnormalities explain the pathogenesis of these diseases and only a few appear disease specific."}

Thus, it was possible to differentiate osteosarcomas from fibrosarcomas by immunostaining. In fibrous dysplasia of bone, BMP was abundant in the fibrocellular tissue that had osteogenic activity. In contrast, fibrous tissue of ossifying fibroma showed weak positive staining; only the osteoblasts rimming the bone showed a positive reaction. Immunostaining showed that BMP was also detected in other neoplastic bone diseases such as osteoma, chondroma, and other tumors."}

It is crucial to establish whether delay in retrieval of donor bone and ambient holding temperature of the donor body influence osteoinductivity of bone left in situ. Of ten adult rats that were killed, five were kept at 4 degrees and five at room temperature. Femurs were harvested at 24, 36, 48, 72, and 168 hours. After processing, segments were implanted in 20 four-week-old syngeneic rats for 14 days. The level of osteoinduction was evaluated histologically. It was excellent in the 4 degrees group in the 24-, 36-, and 48-hour specimens but less advanced at 72 hours. Bone taken from the room temperature group showed findings identical to those kept at 4 degrees through 36 hours, but osteoinduction was less advanced at 48 hours and absent at 72 hours. No bone formed at 168 hours in either temperature group. The following observations were made. (1) Osteoinductivity of demineralized bone left in situ after death was unexpectedly stable. (2) Retrieval time was extended by donor cooling. (3) Microperforated demineralized bone actively induced new bone formation. (4) Ethylene oxide does not inhibit osteoinduction when correctly applied for sterilization. If confirmed in humans, retrieval of bone to be used for osteoinduction could be delayed for some hours, particularly if the donor was immediately refrigerated. This would increase the effective number of bone tissue donors and utilize an undeveloped resource."}

Antiserum against nude mouse spleen cells was added to the early passage cultures to eliminate the host fibroblastic cells. The cell line retained a high activity of liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and secreted osteocalcin, i.e., bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGP), into the medium. The addition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) increased the ALP activity as well as the level of BGP secreted into the medium. The ALP of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells has the same inhibition characteristics to heat and amino acids as that of untreated cells. Synthetic human parathyroid hormone stimulated the production of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) approximately 100-fold within five minutes. However, the stimulation was not observed with a synthetic human thyrocalcitonin. When HuO9 cells were transplanted into the back of a nude mouse, a tumor with an abundant osteoid formation and mineralization was produced. The results indicate that the HuO9 cell line expresses well-differentiated osteoblastic phenotypes. HuO9 is the first established human cell line to produce BGP, and it provides a useful model for the studies of osteoblasts and the regulatory mechanisms of BGP production."}

In comparing cases of hyperadrenocorticism with age- and breed-matched controls with hypothyroidism, the incidence was significantly greater than expected. This was not seen, however, in beagle dogs in which the incidence was already high and attributed to chondrodystrophoid tendencies in this breed. To investigate the pathogenesis of this association and its possible relationship to steroid-induced osteopenia, adult dogs were given a placebo, prednisone, or prednisone plus calcium for six months. Torque testing of intervertebral joints revealed a consistent trend of lower force to failure in both prednisone-treated groups, but the difference was not statistically significant. In these dogs with mild to moderate hyperadrenocorticism, compression tests of intact vertebral bodies were not significantly different, but blocks of trabecular bone cut from the vertebral bodies failed at significantly lower compressive forces in both prednisone-treated groups compared with controls. Histomorphometric evaluation of lumbar vertebral trabecular bone revealed that the percentage of bone volume was not significantly decreased in the prednisone-treated groups. Nor was there any difference in the thickness or porosity of vertebral end-plates, which might contribute to weakening of intervertebral ligamentous insertions."}

The resulting motions between bone segments at the metaphyseal and diaphyseal levels were estimated using measured fixator stiffnesses, postural muscle activity, ground reaction forces, and calculated internal and external loads. Relative displacements of bone segments of up to 2.8 degrees were estimated in postural activities; displacements were up to 4.9 times larger at the metaphyseal than at the diaphyseal osteotomy level. The results suggest that due to these increased motions, mechanically inferior conditions for healing at the metaphyseal-lengthening osteotomy level may counteract any supposedly superior biologic healing potential that the metaphyseal region of the bone may have compared with the diaphyseal region. These results correlate well with the clinical findings of the earlier animal study."}

For management of the scarring of surrounding soft tissue, there has been a change to excision of the scarred tissue and reliance on muscle flap, free-tissue transfer, or closure of soft tissues without irrigation with antibiotic solution. In recent years, free microvascular osseous grafts have permitted more aggressive resection of the involved osseous tissue.

Medical progress had been hindered for more than a millennium by strict adherence to Galen's authority. Flemish-born Vesalius challenged the political and societal forces of the time. At the University of Padua, he studied and later taught human anatomy by performing dissections. His discoveries were published in 1543 in his monumental De Humani Corporis Fabrica. Controversy led to his resignation from the University of Padua. His magnum opus was interpreted as a challenge to both academia and the church. He went to Spain, where he served as personal physician to Emperor Charles V. After almost 20 years in Spain, he became involved in an unfortunate incident that incurred the condemnation of the Inquisition. The royal court's intervention saved Vesalius from being burned at the stake, however, and he was ordered to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to atone for his error. On the return voyage, he became ill and died on the Greek island of Zante."}

Tissue changes include proliferation of synovial cells, alterations in synovial fluid, and degradation of articular cartilage. Synovial cell proliferation results in increased numbers of fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Changes in the synovial fluid include increased content of antibodies, altered complement ratios, increased levels of factors stimulating cartilage-mediated proteoglycan degradation, and decreased levels of insulinlike growth factor I. Levels of cytokine such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 vary with cell culture and assay technique. Cartilage degradation is apparent from increased quantities of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan in serum and synovial fluid. Type II collagen peptide antibodies are also prevalent in JRA patients. Cartilage degradation appears linked to factors in JRA synovial fluid. Conditioned medium of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with JRA also stimulates increased release of cartilage proteoglycan. Thus, the outcome in JRA likely reflects activities of interacting soluble factors that directly influence cartilage homeostasis."}

Because of ethical concerns about studying children, the difficulty of obtaining tissue, and the heterogeneous manifestations and protean course of chronic arthritis in childhood, the scope of potential research has been severely limited. This brief review summarizes a few of the animal models most commonly used in chronic inflammatory arthritis research: subcutaneous air pouch, antigen-induced (including arthritogenic infectious agent), and spontaneous models. In the spontaneous and antigen-induced animal models of arthritis, local and systemic immunoregulatory abnormalities clearly play a major role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. By elucidating the immune response to those antigens, as well as the role of genetics and environment, the pathogenesis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis may be better understood. At the present time, however, the complexity of these models precludes more definitive interpretation and extrapolation to human diseases."}

The average time before significant improvement is noticed is over 30 days in the 50% of the children who respond to any NSAID within three months. The percentage of responders progressively increases with the length of therapy, so treatment should be continued until one is reasonably certain that improvement will not occur before changing medication. In the more severely involved child, gold and other disease-modifying medications are used. However, it has been difficult to prove the value of these medications in controlled studies because of the high rate of significant improvement in the control group treated with NSAIDs.

They obtained and reviewed charts of infants (n = 66) having paired superficial (skin and/or gastric aspirate) and deep (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) cultures for the evaluation of early-onset sepsis. Superficial cultures were positive for pathogens (any streptococcus or enteric gram-negative) in 15% (10/66) of cases. Antimicrobial decision making was affected in only one of these cases, and in a seemingly inappropriate manner. In summary, there was no evidence or review that superficial cultures used in sepsis evaluation influenced physician antimicrobial decision making; in one case they may have led to unnecessary antibiotic exposure."}

In addition, fibroblasts profile of VLCFA and plasmalogen levels were evaluated for Case 2. Pathomorphological examinations represented by lymph node and kidney biopsies as well as postmortem examinations of liver, adrenals and brain were performed in Case 1. The phenotypes of both siblings showed marked resemblance to those observed in children with Zellweger syndrome. The results of biochemical tests performed in Case 1, together with abundant peroxisomes in the liver and the wide spectrum of clinical abnormalities suggest pseudo-Zellweger or Zellweger-like syndromes, but no conclusive data have been found. The plasmalogen level in fibroblasts as well as the fibroblasts profile of VLCFA noted in Case 2 were within the normal range, thus excluding the possibility of a peroxisomal disorder. The striking phenotype resemblance of the siblings mimicking Zellweger, together with discordant biochemical findings, are difficult to explain on the basis of currently available tests."}

The type and amount of thyroid hormone replacement, selection of laboratory tests, and timing of office visits are all important for optimizing patient well-being and reducing the costs of medical care. The aim of treatment is to bring the patient to the euthyroid state. Currently this is defined as a normal serum concentration of TSH by recently developed sensitive and specific immunometric assays, and is accomplished by titrating the dose of levothyroxine and changing it not more often than at 4- to 6-week intervals. As an indicator of euthyroidism, the sensitive TSH assay has advantages over tests of serum T4, FT4I, T3, FT4, and TSH by RIA because it is independent of TBG changes that result from pregnancy, birth-control pills, and estrogen replacement, is not spuriously elevated by the levothyroxine treatment itself, and is the only test that detects both subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Additional serum tests are not usually necessary but have advantages under special circumstances. Once the optimal replacement dose is determined, monitoring can be done yearly or even bi-yearly, depending on the adequacy of patient education and patient compliance."}

In the GPMT, both dithranol and, to a greater extent, butantrone showed sensitizing potential. Because butantrone was less irritant, the concentrations used were 10x higher than those of dithranol. In the CPT, only butantrone was slightly positive. In the MEST, with both CF-1 and Balb/c mice, dithranol caused less swelling of the test ear after challenge than butantrone. According to the evaluation criteria of the MEST, only butantrone caused sensitization in 50% of the CF-1 mice and in 40% of the Balb/c mice. Thus, the GPMT was the only test which indicated the minor contact sensitizing potential of dithranol.

Using 3 different guinea pig strains, development was attempted of an experimental guinea pig model that would allow for in-depth studies into the mechanism of sensitization, and a possible role of transdermal device components. Transient low-level clonidine allergy could be obtained only in a minority of animals, with severe sensitization procedures departing from epicutaneous applications, combined with intradermal (adjuvant) FCA injections. Sensitization was not potentiated by additional booster procedures, including cyclophosphamide pretreatment, nor any of the putative cofactors (UV-treatments, C. parvum or acetaldehyde involvement) studied. These results suggest that the persistent skin contacts in man, with transdermal devices for sustained drug delivery, generate unique conditions favouring the development of allergic contact dermatitis, which are difficult to mimic in experimental animal models. Thus, clinical allergy may develop even to extremely weak sensitizing drugs that can be safely used orally, and escape most currently available predictive contact allergy animal models. Clinical studies remain unavoidable for studying factors that may reduce sensitization rates to more acceptable levels."}

The notation (meth)acrylates is used to refer to both acrylates and methacrylates. (Meth)acrylate monomers will polymerize in the absence of oxygen when induced by metal ions, peroxides, heat or ultraviolet light. The monomers are of low viscosity and remain in the liquid state at temperatures far below 0 degree C. The volatile compounds, some of which exhibit a most pungent odour, have a tendency to penetrate all tissue and to permeate into the finest fissures, a property which makes them suitable as sealants, glues, embedding material, etc. This and their toxicity may represent a danger to the health of individuals who need to work with them, especially if no precautions are taken. We show with patch testing that one patient reacted strongly to the compound 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate at the dilutions tested (0.5 and 1% v/v), but not at all to 10 other (meth)acrylates. In the same test, 3 volunteer controls were negative to 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. We demonstrate that at maximum working concentration, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate penetrates both latex and vinyl gloves and elicits irritant/allergic reactions on the patient and irritant reactions on a control. Finally, we discuss the necessary protective measures."}

To test pulse oximeter reliability in children under these conditions, our study compared 187 SaO2 pulse oximeter readings (Biox 3700) with simultaneous hemoximeter (OSM2, Radiometer) readings from 56 children rewarming after open heart surgery. Ages ranged from 4 months to 18 yr; temperatures ranged from 23.5 degrees to 38 degrees C (toe) and 31.3 degrees to 40.8 degrees C (core). The mean pulse oximeter SaO2 reading was 94.90% (SD 7.18, range 54% to 100%), mean hemoximeter reading was 96.07% (SD 7.06; minimum 54%; maximum 100%). The correlation between the readings was high (r = .88, p less than .005), and was not affected by low core temperature. When oximeter and cardiac monitor pulse rates coincided, the oximeter SaO2 value was within +/- 5% (p less than .05). We conclude that the Biox 3700 oximeter is reliable for noninvasive SaO2 monitoring in mild to moderately hypothermic children after open heart surgery, particularly when oximeter and cardiac heart rates coincide.

This was validated against the single breath occlusion technique in 15 infants (birth weight 0.9 to 4.4 kg). To ensure fully passive expiration, only paralyzed or sedated patients were studied. Only 12 of the 15 infants were analyzed because of limitations in the single breath technique. In three infants the flow-volume curves obtained were alinear, indicating inhomogeneity. In the 12 infants with acceptable single breath data, agreement between the two methods was excellent. Using the expired volume, r2 was .99.

Consecutive surgical ICU patients requiring triple lumen catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, or arterial catheters for greater than 7 days were prospectively randomized to one of three management groups: a) percutaneous (PERC) puncture with every 7-day catheter change at a new site, b) no weekly change (NWC) with a new site when changed, or c) guidewire exchange (GWX) with every 7-day catheter change at the same site. In all groups, a catheter change was mandatory for a positive blood culture, skin site infection, or sepsis without a likely source. Cultures were obtained when clinically indicated and at the time of every catheter change. Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) was defined as a positive blood culture and catheter culture with the same organism. A total of 112 patients met evaluation criteria. There were no intergroup differences in age, primary diagnosis, severity of injury or illness, number of study days, number of protocol violations, route of catheterization, number of catheters present/patient day, catheter sepsis rate, or bacteremia rate. The NWC group demonstrated an increased number of days/catheter, fewer catheter/subcutaneous tract segment cultures/patient, and a reduced incidence of catheter tip colonization. These results occurred in a setting where the number of CRS episodes/patient was 0.17 for GWX, 0.22 for PERC, and 0.16 for NWC. We conclude that there is no difference in infectious risk between these three methods of long-term catheter management. The method with the least complications and expense should be used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Respiratory system resistance (Rrs,max) was partitioned into its homogeneous (Rrs,min) and uneven (Rrs,u) components. Respiratory system elastance (Ers) was also measured. In both groups Ers did not vary with different inspiratory flows and volumes, but was significantly higher in ARDS. With increasing volume (isoflow maneuvers), Rrs,max and Rrs,u increased but Rrs,min remained unaltered in ARDS. In control patients, however, resistances did not vary but Rrs,max and Rrs,u were smaller and Rrs,min equaled their corresponding values in ARDS. Hence, stress relaxation seems to be increased in ARDS. During isovolume maneuvers Rrs,max and Rrs,u decreased with increasing flows (both groups), although they were significantly higher in ARDS. Rrs,min was not modified by different flows and was similar in both groups. Thus, pendelluft is also increased in ARDS. In conclusion, the mechanical profile of ARDS is characterized by increased Ers and Rrs,max, the latter being secondary to augmented mechanical unevenness within the system."}

We evaluated a recently developed pH probe incorporated into an NG tube and compared it with aspiration of gastric contents using pH paper as a means to monitor pH in 22 surgical ICU patients. Regression analysis comparing the intragastric probe pH values with the aspirated pH values showed a good correlation between the two methods (r = .71).

The thoracic and abdominal gauges were calibrated simultaneously in quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The delta FRC measured during HFJV (1 to 5 Hz) and the VT measured during IPPV (0.25 Hz) were found to be equivalent by the two gauges in most patients (r = .90 and r = .99, respectively), but no correlation was found between the VT values inferred by each gauge in HFJV (r = .54). During HFJV, spectral analysis of the gauge signals showed important damping of the abdominal motion (AB) and an amplification of the thoracic displacements (RC) in four patients when measurements were taken at greater than 3 Hz.

Analysis was performed separately for all patients (group A) and for a subsample (group B), obtained by excluding coronary care patients. Calculation of risk and classification of patients were carried out as recommended in the literature for MPM, APACHE II, and SAPS. In group A, sensitivities (correct prediction of hospital mortality) were 44.7%, 51.1%, and 21.2% and specificities (correct prediction of survival) were 84.5%, 85.4%, and 96.8%, respectively; overall correct classification rates were 73.3%, 75.8%, and 75.6%. In group B, sensitivities were slightly higher, but total correct classification rates did not reach group A levels. Goodness-of-fit testing showed low levels of fit for all methods in both groups. Application of APACHE II to diagnostic subgroups, using disease-adapted risk calculations, revealed marked inconsistencies between the estimated risk and the observed mortality. We conclude that the estimation of risk on admission by the three methods investigated might be helpful for global comparisons of ICU populations, although the lack of disease specificity reduces their applicability for severity grading of a given illness. The inaccuracy of these methods makes them ineffective for predicting individual outcome; thus, they provide little advantage in clinical decision-making."}

During an 8-month period, 1,927 patients transported by six helicopter emergency medical service programs were studied. Over 97% (1,881) of the patients had RAPS obtained before and after transport to the receiving hospital and 92.6% (1,785) had APACHE II scoring completed after hospital admission.

This study demonstrated that PGE1 reduced PAP and cardiac output by a preload-mediated mechanism, as evidenced by a reduction in the right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic segment length, at doses of 15 and 30 ng/kg.min. The second study was performed in two groups of animals, the control group (n = 6), and the treated group (n = 6), which were given PGE1 at 15 ng/kg.min after the PAP had been doubled by glass bead embolism.

The mean weight of 1000 successive units of erythrocytes for adult infusion was 305 g (range 220 to 410). The maximum temperature was 44 degrees C, using an internal temperature probe (1-cm temperature gradations; 2-sec recording intervals) when the smallest unit was admixed with a 250 ml 70 degrees C saline bolus; the largest unit had a minimum temperature of 30 degrees C. Plasma Hgb, osmotic fragility, and K of the minimum size erythrocyte unit showed no significant deviation from its control. Both thermographic photographs and the internal temperature recordings of the erythrocyte units demonstrated that solely due to fluid turbulence, uniform mixing occurs within approximately 30 sec of beginning the admixture process. Inverting the blood units caused a thermal layering of fluids and an unacceptable maximum blood temperature of 50 degrees C. There was no difference between the mixing time or efficacy in the presence of standard or large-bore iv tubing or additional in-line filters. Volumes of the 250-ml saline bags for admixture decreased markedly with deviations in electrolyte composition after greater than 2 wk at 70 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Seven adult mongrel dogs were given a general anesthetic, and monitoring lines were inserted. The animals were then subjected to an incremental volume overload of approximately 13% of estimated initial blood volume at 5-min intervals until a total volume infusion nearly equal to the animal's initial blood volume was reached. Comparison of the various monitoring techniques (e.g., cardiac output, CVP, systemic BP, pulmonary wedge pressure) demonstrated that the peripheral measurement of CORRP had better correlation with known administered volume (r = .96) than any of the other variables. The sensitivity of each of the variables in assessing small amounts of volume overload was also studied. The volume of crystalloid infusion necessary to cause a clinically significant change (defined as greater than 2 SD above the baseline mean) was compared for each of the monitoring variables. CORRP was equivalent to the other variables in sensing early volume overload. In summary, in the anesthetized animal model CORRP appears to be a sensitive, minimally invasive method of assessing volume status in acute volume overload. The efficacy of CORRP in a canine hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion model had previously been demonstrated. This technique could be clinically applicable in situations such as trauma with hemorrhagic shock, intraoperative volume changes, and in the assessment of intravascular volume after resuscitation."}

Organ capillary blood flow and the fractional distribution of cardiac output were measured by the microsphere (9-microns diameter) trapping method in dogs. Simultaneously, the arteriolovenous shunt rate was measured by continuous collection of venous blood drained at 4.8 ml.min-1 for 2 min from the brain, kidney, liver, splanchnic organs, skeletal muscle of the pelvic limb, and all of the systemic circulatory organs. The capillary blood flow of the brain, thyroid gland, pancreas, and stomach decreased after circulatory arrest in five nonhemodiluted dogs (group C); arteriolovenous shunt rate was unchanged after circulatory arrest in this group. However, with hemodilution, which was induced either before (pre group, n = 5) or after (post group, n = 5) circulatory arrest, no change occurred in the shunt rate in any of the organs, with the exception of an increase in the systemic arteriolovenous shunt rate in the pre group. Capillary blood flow was maintained at almost the same level as before circulatory arrest in the pre group, but increased significantly in several organs of the post group. The data indicated that hemodilution might be effective for prevention of organ ischemia after cardiac arrest."}

This study investigates whether the increased Qbr seen 24 h after inhalation injury can be affected by mechanical ventilation with PEEP (5, 10, 15 cm H2O). Sheep (n = 8) previously prepared with cardiopulmonary catheters and ultrasonic transit time flow probes mounted around their bronchial arteries were insufflated with four sets of 12 breaths each of cotton smoke. Different levels of PEEP were added to the mechanical ventilation 24 h after injury; each PEEP level was applied for 45 min. There were significant increases in Qbr and lung lymph flow (QL) associated with a marked decrease in bronchial vascular resistance (BVR) 24 h after injury. However, no change was observed in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or cardiac index (CI). There was a substantial reduction in PaO2/FIO2 (P/F), which indicated a deterioration in arterial oxygenation. The application of varying levels of PEEP decreased Qbr (p less than .05) while BVR increased (p less than .05), but QL and P/F did not. CI and MAP were recorded. After removal of PEEP, none of the cardiopulmonary variables were significantly different from their postsmoke control values. These findings suggest that mechanical ventilation with PEEP markedly decreases the smoke-induced hyperemia edema frequently seen after inhalation injury without any significant alterations in MAP or CI."}

Simultaneously with RHC, transmitral flow velocity profiles were obtained by tpDE, and the ratio of the velocity-time integrals of late diastolic active (A wave) and early diastolic passive inflow into the left ventricle (E wave) was calculated (A/E ratio). Invasively determined pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) ranged from 3 to 36 mm Hg (median 13.35, 5%/95% 6/31 mm Hg). Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the A/E ratio and WP (r = .98, p less than .001, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.10). The A/E ratio also correlated with other hemodynamic variables such as cardiac output (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.33), cardiac index (r = -.74, p less than .001, SEE = 0.31), and stroke volume index (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.34). The interobserver agreement (derived by intraclass correlation analysis between two examiners) on the A/E ratio was high (r = .95, p less than .001, n = 26). We conclude that WP can be accurately determined noninvasively by tpDE. For the assessment of systolic ventricular function, tpDE is of limited diagnostic value."}

On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress. However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce. On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients. Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing. It remains to be seen whether this concept will be useful in the treatment of critically ill surgical patients."}

Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants."}

This unstable diabetes mellitus together with side effects of nausea and vomiting resulted in weight loss and inadequate serum therapeutic levels that was associated with a poor therapeutic response to the cyclosporine. The major side effects in both patients were headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, but there was no renal dysfunction.

Moreover, these patients can be considered at risk for secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Therefore, we have investigated the occurrence of associated secondary alveolar proteinosis and PC pneumonitis in AIDS and non-AIDS immunocompromised patients. In a series of 26 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) in patients with PC pneumonitis (19 AIDS and seven non-AIDS patients), we observed on light microscopy, in addition to the honeycombed material, areas of an extracellular material that had a different pattern which was suggestive of that described in alveolar proteinosis. A systematic ultrastructural study of these 26 BAL fluid samples demonstrated in each of them an accumulation of phospholipid surfactantlike extracellular material mixed or not with the PC cysts. In nine cases, the observation of lipoproteinaceous material on light microscopy and abundant phospholipid material with myelinlike and myelin tubular laminated structures on electron microscopy was highly suggestive of an associated pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Such an accumulation of extracellular material was not observed in the 11 BAL fluid samples collected in immunocompromised patients (seven AIDS and four non-AIDS patients) without PC pneumonitis. These findings demonstrated a particular frequency of associated PAP with PC pneumonitis. These results raise important questions concerning (1) the consequence of such an alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material on the clinical status and prognosis of the pneumonitis, and (2) the mechanisms responsible for this accumulation."}

Thirty-two men with documented CAD who complained of frequent and usually daily retrosternal chest pain were evaluated. Following a standard esophageal manometry and acid perfusion test, simultaneous two-channel ambulatory Holter monitor and esophageal pH record tests were performed for 24 hours. Fifty-three episodes of chest pain were documented in 20 patients; 11 patients were free of pain. Of the 20 patients who complained of chest pains, 17 (85 percent) demonstrated at least one episode of PPR, defined as a drop in distal esophageal pH to less than 4 within ten minutes before or after the onset chest pain. Episodes of asymptomatic GER were common. The correlation of PPR with chest pain was 70 percent (37/53 episodes) and of ischemic ECG changes with chest pain 13 percent (7/53); in the remaining, there was no correlation with either. Two patients demonstrated simultaneous PPR and ischemic ECG changes. Seventeen esophageal motility abnormalities were observed in 14 patients (45 percent). It is our conclusion that esophageal disorders contribute to chest pain in patients with documented CAD. In this group, GER plays a greater role than in those with normal coronary arteries. In addition, esophageal motility disorders are common in these patients. Esophageal testing can be undertaken safely in these patients."}

We have now investigated whether the use of potassium-sparing drugs might prevent the ECG sequelae of such combined therapy. Ten healthy subjects received seven days of randomized treatments with: placebo, bendrofluazide (5 mg), bendrofluazide plus triamterene 50 mg (conventional dose), or triamterene 200 mg (high dose), and bendrofluazide plus spironolactone (100 mg). Potassium and ECG responses to inhaled salbutamol, 2 mg, were measured after each treatment period. The T-wave flattening in response to bendrofluazide and salbutamol (0.24[CI, 0.19 to 0.29]mV) was attenuated by the addition of triamterene, 200 mg (0.33[CI, 0.28 to 0.37]mV; p less than 0.05) and spironolactone 100 mg (0.42[CI, 0.37 to 0.47]mV; p less than 0.01), but not by triamterene 50 mg (0.25[CI, 0.20 to 0.30]mV). Spironolactone and high dose triamterene also diminished the frequency of U waves and ST depression. The ECG effects mirrored hypokalemic responses which were also blunted by high dose (p less than 0.01) but not low dose triamterene, as well as by spironolactone (p less than 0.001). Thus, the use of high dose triamterene and spironolactone protected against the hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy, whereas a conventional dose of triamterene had no effect. These findings may be important in the prevention of a potentially dangerous interaction in susceptible patients taking this combination of drugs."}

Of 315 patients evaluated for potential cardiac transplantation at UCLA, 132 underwent pulmonary function tests. The latter patients had severe heart failure with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 19 percent and mean cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m2. Diffusion impairment either alone or combined with restrictive and/or obstructive ventilatory defects occurred in 67 percent of the patients evaluated. Diffusion impairment occurred as the sole abnormality in 31 percent of the patients and in combination with a restrictive ventilatory defect in 21 percent. A reduction in diffusing capacity has not been previously described as a frequent finding in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In contrast to other studies involving patients with acute heart failure, obstructive ventilatory defects were uncommon. None of the lung function abnormalities was associated with smoking status, prior drug use, chest roentgenographic changes, hemodynamic findings, or clinical features, including duration of congestive heart failure. The mechanism for the diffusion impairment is unclear but could be due to chronic passive congestion with pulmonary fibrosis and/or recurrent pulmonary emboli.

One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for asthma in the past year. Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed medications. Side effects, especially tachycardia and insomnia, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy. Spirometric assessment showed chronic airflow obstruction in those with more severe asthma.

The cardiac index rose significantly at rest and under exercise only after the administration of nifedipine (+16 percent and +8 percent, resp). Nifedipine caused the most distinctive peripheral vasodilation. The heart rate increased slightly following nifedipine and decreased slightly following diltiazem and verapamil. After long-term therapy with nifedipine (13 +/- 5 months), the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was no longer significant. In our opinion, the different hemodynamic action profiles will have consequences for the differential therapy in patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension."}

All the patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of the study, and PLNA was performed either because of a lack of response to empiric antibiotic treatment or because of the severity of the pneumonia or the underlying condition of the patient. Eight patients were mechanically ventilated (MV) due to acute respiratory failure. The PLNA was performed at bedside and without fluoroscopic guidance. Twenty-two microorganisms were identified by means of stains and/or cultures of PLNA samples. Sensitivity of PLNA was 43 percent (18/41). We detected three false-positive cultures probably due to contamination from the skin area punctured. In the eight MV patients studied, the sensitivity of PLNA was 37.5 percent, and the microbiologic findings turned out to be crucial for the outcome of the patients. Pneumothorax developed in three patients (7 percent) after PLNA. None of these three patients developed a pleural infection but two of them required thoracostomy drainage. None of the MV patients presented complications. Our results showed that nonfluoroscopic PLNA is a technique with moderately good sensitivity and with a low rate of false-positive cultures (8 percent) to diagnose pulmonary infections in patients with unresponsiveness to empiric antibiotic treatment or with severe pneumonia. Further evaluation of its diagnostic value and complications in MV patients is needed, although our preliminary results suggest that PLNA can be an alternative technique to other methods for diagnosing pulmonary infections in patients receiving artificial ventilatory support."}

The drugs were given as aerosols by MDI to 16 patients with nocturnal asthma in a stable phase. The inhalations were given at 10 PM and the FEV1 values as parameter were measured before and at 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours afterwards. The FEV1 6 hours after administration of formoterol was significantly higher than that after albuterol (ANCOVA: p = 0.008), and this was still the case 12 hours after the test dose at 10 AM the following morning (ANCOVA: p = 0.009). At 4 AM, the FEV1 fell below the basic starting value after albuterol, whereas it remained at least 10 percent above the formoterol inhalation. Five patients required rescue therapy after albuterol and two after formoterol. We conclude that formoterol in a dose of 12 micrograms via MDI confers good protection against nocturnal asthma; this was only insufficient for some patients with severe asthma, and further studies with higher dosages in these patients are clearly indicated."}

We sought to elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of inhaled PAF on methacholine and isoproterenol airway responsiveness in six nonasthmatic and six asthmatic subjects. Neither nonspecific airway reactivity nor isoproterenol responsiveness was changed following PAF inhalation in the nonasthmatic subjects in the six days following PAF.

Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and one hour after the start of epinephrine infusion. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure increased in all patients (p less than 0.01). Cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance increased by 34 and 32 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05), but heart rate and pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. There was a concomitant increase in oxygen delivery (p less than 0.01) and oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), the magnitude of the latter being related to baseline lactacidemia (p less than 0.01). In view of the generally recognized physiologic goals of septic shock management, we conclude that epinephrine could be an appropriate alternative where fluid loading and dopamine have failed."}

Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention. Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3. The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001). After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05). This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2. The addition of a second detecting fiber optic filament does not seem to improve the accuracy of the system when SvO2 changes occur in conditions of stable hematocrit."}

Twenty-four anesthetized and ventilated adult mongrel dogs were instrumented for regional blood flow determinations using radio-labeled microspheres. The dogs were randomized to receive either 20 mg of methoxamine as a single intravenous bolus or repeated boluses of 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, 0.2 mg/kg of epinephrine, or normal saline solution placebo beginning at three minutes following induction of VF and initiation of closed chest cardiac massage (CCCM). Organ blood flow measurements were determined during normal sinus rhythm and after five and 20 minutes of VF. All six dogs receiving methoxamine were successfully resuscitated in contrast to only one in each of the epinephrine-treated groups and none of the dogs receiving placebo (p less than .01). Although epinephrine was associated with significantly higher blood pressures than placebo during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), blood pressures achieved with methoxamine were significantly higher than those observed in the other three treatment groups (p less than .001). Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher with both methoxamine and high-dose epinephrine (p less than .05). Mean left and right ventricular myocardial flows were highest with methoxamine but this did not achieve statistical significance. In contrast, organ flows measured in the animals receiving the lowest dose of epinephrine were not significantly higher than those associated with placebo. Cardiac output after 20 minutes of CPR was significantly lower with high-dose epinephrine than with methoxamine or placebo (p less than .05). Our results suggest that methoxamine significantly improves regional cerebral blood flow and survival during CPR and although high-dose epinephrine is associated with comparable improvements in regional cerebral blood flow, this treatment is associated with deterioration in central hemodynamics during prolonged VF and does not enhance survival."}

The mortality rate was 5 percent (3 of 66) after resective surgery and 17 percent (5 of 30) after nonresective surgery. Three deaths were related to the malignant disease, three were related to the intra-abdominal infection, and two were related to formation of intestinocutaneous fistulas. Of the 8 patients who died, 1 had a tumor with local visceral involvement only and 7 had a tumor with more distant spread. Median survival was 10 months for all patients, 15 months for patients treated with resective surgery, and 7 months for nonresected patients. Five patients (5 percent) have survived for longer than 5 years. The median relief of preoperative cancer symptoms was 4 months (4 months after resective surgery and 1 month after nonresective surgery). Twenty-five patients have undergone second surgery. It is concluded that palliative resective surgery for colorectal cancer can improve patient comfort with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate when cancer growth is localized and in favorable cases with more distant spread, whereas nonresective surgery fails to achieve symptom relief."}

A chronic lack of SCFAs or complete organ starvation in conjunction with other factors leads to nutritional colitis, either \"diversion colitis\" or \"starvation colitis.\" Whether predominantly diarrhea or colitis develops in mucosal malnutrition appears to depend upon the severity and duration of starvation.

Lymph node metastases can be predicted with a sensitivity of 72 percent and inflammatory lymph nodes with a specificity of 83 percent. The physical basis of the differentiation of lymph nodes was assessed in vitro by the determination of ultrasound parameters (speed of sound, acoustic impedance, attenuation, and backscattered amplitude). The attenuation coefficient of benign lymph nodes [2.5 dB/(MHz x cm)] is significantly higher than the mean value of lymph node metastases [1.3 db/(MHz x cm)]. The results demonstrate that involved nodes can principally be differentiated from not involved nodes. Micrometastases, mixed lymph nodes, and changing echo patterns within inflammatory nodes explain the accuracy rate of 78 percent."}

The majority of tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm in diameter and all invaded at least into the submucosa and/or the lamina propria. At diagnosis, one third of the patients had either regional or distant metastasis with a median survival of 5 months. The remaining patients were surgically treated with curative intent, either by abdominoperineal resection (APR) or local excision. Median survival was poor in both treatment groups (APR, 12 months; local excision, 13 months). Most patients died with distant metastasis. Our results confirm the opinion that APR offers no more curative potential than a more conservative surgical approach. However, tumor sizes were on average smaller in the group treated by local excision. This could indicate that, in the absence of known distant metastasis, radical surgery should be performed, particularly since local recurrences tended to be more common after a local excision."}

For the quantitative description of anastomotic repair, both mechanical and biochemical parameters are employed, each with their own limitations. Mechanical parameters, either bursting pressure or breaking strength, only reflect growing anastomotic strength as long as disruption occurs within the anastomotic area, which is less than one week after surgery for the bursting pressure and probably up to two weeks for the breaking strength. The biochemical description of anastomotic repair has been limited to behavior of collagen, as represented by its rather unique constituent amino acid hydroxyproline. Conclusions based on collagen concentrations--per unit weight--should be considered with caution since they may change as a consequence of changes in noncollagenous substances. In this respect, collagen content, per unit length, is probably a better parameter to describe anastomotic collagen levels. Few investigations have addressed the quality of collagen (e.g., crosslinking or type). Since, at this time, no distinct correlations have been demonstrated between development of mechanical strength or occurrence of leakage and collagen levels in the healing anastomosis, attention should not be restricted to a description of the quantity of collagen present: the quality of anastomotic collagen should be investigated, perhaps even more so."}

During the night, propagated contractions (0.136/min) and simultaneous contractions (0.025/min) were significantly less frequent than during both meal (1.31/min and 0.172/min, respectively) and nonmeal daytimes (0.665/min and 0.133/min, respectively), whereas the nocturnal segmental contraction frequency (0.181/min) was not significantly lower than the nonmeal daytime contraction frequency (0.243/min). Median reflux time was in the normal range (1.2%), although two subjects had prolonged reflux times (9.5% and 14.5%). In conclusion, all subjects showed similar patterns of diurnal esophageal contractory activity determined partly by meal intake and partly by a characteristic clustering of nocturnal contractions that could not be explained by episodes of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. It may, therefore, be speculated that nocturnal contraction clusters are associated with rhythmic phenomena such as MMC or specific sleep stages."}

Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were utilized. Tablets or control plastic beads were secured to a silk suture thread and positioned in the rabbit esophagus through a proximal esophagostomy and a gastrostomy. Test medications were allowed to dissolve passively on the surface of the esophageal mucosa in the anesthetized rabbits. After 1 hr of drug exposure, the rabbits were killed and the esophagus removed and examined. No gross abnormalities were detected with the exception of a mild degree of erythema at some of the exposure sites. All medications and control beads produced microscopic mucosal changes when compared to suture controls. The beads and test medications caused thinning of the epithelium and increased subepithelial edema (P less than 0.05). Two changes, however, were unique to animals exposed to test medications: fraying and/or splitting of the epithelium and the presence of balloon cells (P less than 0.05). Balloon cells represent damaged squamous epithelial cells recognizable by their distended, globoid shape. The prevalence of balloon cells ranged from 22% to 89% of sites exposed to drug and was most commonly associated with potassium. Of all drugs reported to cause injury to the human esophagus, potassium chloride has been reported to produce the most severe lesions, including esophageal stricture and perforation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Measurement of neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity might thus be a sensitive indicator of damage, before visible lesions occur. To test this possibility, a rat model for duodenal injury was used where fasted animals were treated with indomethacin and histamine-diHCl. Twenty-four hours after indomethacin treatment, duodenal tissues were collected for histochemical staining and biochemical assay for myeloperoxidase activity. Indomethacin- and histamine-challenged rats had significantly elevated myeloperoxidase activity compared to unchallenged controls (P less than 0.05) for both histochemistry and biochemistry. There was also a significant correlation between these two parameters (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001). The duodenal injury model then was used to test the effectiveness of known gastric protective agents. Results indicated that milk and buttermilk did not aggravate or protect against duodenal injury, while antacid and prostaglandin did significantly protect against inflammation (P less than 0.02). We concluded that measurement of myeloperoxidase activity is a sensitive and potentially useful estimate of duodenal injury that can be valuable in assessing ulcerogenesis and healing."}

The method was shown to enrich for dividing cells (6.92 +/- 0.693%, N = 43, 2-hr labeling) in the digest from the intact tissue and was therefore unsuitable for estimating unscheduled DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa induced by chemicals or drugs including omeprazole. It was further shown that neither omeprazole or its acid-activated product, a cationic sulfenamide, were able to react with isolated purified DNA from either a prokaryote (E. coli) or a eukaryote (salmon sperm). Hence any conclusions using this method attributing acute genotoxic effects to any chemical are based on unrecognized artifacts of the technique and are unsound. In addition, these results negate the suggestion that omeprazole or its gastric metabolites are genotoxic."}

We found that although a liposomal suspension of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) administered intragastrically failed to protect rats from acid-induced gastric ulcer formation, addition of cholesterol to unsaturated PC induced a dose-dependent protective response with the maximally effective dose, reducing lesion score greater than 70%. This effect also was seen with the plant sterol, beta-sitosterol (reducing lesion score by 81.6 +/- 36%) but was blocked if cholesterol was esterified to fatty acids of varying chain length. Addition of sterols to liposomes of saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, in contrast, attenuated the gastric protective action of the saturated PC. It appears that the protective mechanism elicited by sterols and unsaturated PC is not mediated by alterations in gastric emptying rate or prostaglandin biosynthesis, although maintenance of surface hydrophobicity may be involved. These results suggest that the sterol may promote the packing of adjacent unsaturated phospholipid molecules of either the cell membrane or a putative extracellular hydrophobic lining of the gastric epithelium to provide the mucosa with protection against luminal acid."}

Under basal conditions, pHs was roughly equal in both parts of the duodenum; proximal duodenum, 7.40 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SEM) at the villus tip and 7.54 +/- 0.16 at the depth of crypt; distal duodenum, 7.46 +/- 0.19 and 7.55 +/- 0.09, respectively. Yet, exposure of the mucosa to luminal acid (10 mM HCl) provoked a significantly lesser decrease of pHs (0.25 +/- 0.13 vs 0.42 +/- 0.12 pH units) in the proximal duodenum, suggesting that the response of epithelial HCO3 secretion to luminal acid is stronger in that part of the duodenum. Further, the initial acidification of pHs was followed in the proximal duodenum by a secondary alkalinization of pHs, leading to normalization of pHs, which may suggest activation of compensatory protective mechanisms. pHt at the villus tip was likewise roughly equal in both parts of duodenum (7.29 +/- 0.05 vs 7.17 +/- 0.04), but, again, acidification of the luminal perfusate progressively from 10 to 100 mM HCl induced a much earlier and significantly more profound acidification in the distal than in the proximal duodenum.

In the hysterectomy group, more IBS patients had chronic pelvic pain (P less than 0.005), and abnormal menses (P less than 0.01). Chronic pelvic pain was more frequently the only prehysterectomy diagnosis in IBS patients (P less than 0.05), and IBS was present more often when pain was a reason for hysterectomy (P less than 0.01). One year after laparoscopy, IBS patients gave lower overall status ratings (P less than 0.01) and lower pain improvement ratings (P less than 0.05) than non-IBS patients. In women who had a hysterectomy for pain, there was less pain improvement one year later in those with the pain subtype of IBS than in non-IBS patients (P less than 0.05). IBS is associated with gynecologic symptoms and affects the symptomatic outcome of diagnostic laparoscopy and hysterectomy."}

Subjects were initially allocated to one of two groups; one group was trained to perceive small rectal volumes (active retraining), the other group carried out the same maneuvers but were not given any information or instruction. Active sensory retraining reduced the sensory threshold from 32 +/- 8 to 7 +/- 2 ml (P less than 0.001), corrected any sensory delay that was present (P less than 0.004), and reduced the frequency of incontinence from 5 +/- 1 to 1 +/- 1 episodes per week (P less than 0.01). Sham retraining caused a modest reduction in the sensory threshold (from 29 +/- 9 to 20 +/- 8; P less than 0.05) but did not significantly reduce the frequency of incontinence. Subsequent strength and coordination training did not significantly improve continence, although at the end of the study, 50% of patients had no incontinent episodes at all and 76% of patients had reduced the frequency of incontinence episodes by more than 75%. This improvement in continence was not associated with any change in sphincter pressures or in the continence to rectally infused saline but was associated with significant improvements in rectal sensation. The functional improvement was sustained over a period of two years in 16 of the 22 patients available for follow-up. In conclusion, the results support the use of retraining in the management of fecal incontinence and suggest that retraining may work by enhancing rectal sensitivity and instilling confidence."}

In multivariate analyses, duration of diabetes, menarchal status, and diastolic blood pressure were associated with the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy. After partitioning the duration of diabetes into years before and years after menarche, both were significant, but the number of years of diabetes after menarche was more strongly associated. At a 4-yr follow-up examination, more postmenarchal than premenarchal females had progression of their retinopathy (P = 0.06).

Blood tests included total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HbA1c. These tests were repeated at three time points during the program. Field-strength testing was performed before and after training. An improvement was seen in the squat (93.6% increase, P less than 0.0001) and bench press (58% increase, P less than 0.005). HbA1c and triglyceride levels showed no change during the resting portion of the experiment but showed a significant change with the training program: HbA1c 6.9 +/- 1.4 vs 5.8 +/- 0.9% (P = 0.05) and triglyceride 5.044 +/- 1.06 vs. 4.628 +/- 0.88 mM (P = 0.01).

Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus, not treated with insulin, who had inadequate glucose control on diet alone or diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied. Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a standardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling. During the 6-mo study, both the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed similar improvement in glycemic control; within each group, there were significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (reduction of 1.4 +/- 3.2 mM, P less than 0.03) and glycosylated hemoglobin (reduction of 2.0 +/- 3.4%, P less than 0.01) levels. Seventeen (31%) of 54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values, 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group. Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose (P greater than 0.86), glycosylated hemoglobin (P greater than 0.95), or weight (P greater than 0.19). In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin, SMBG is no more effective, but is 8-12 times more expensive, than urine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control. Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin."}

Three hundred fourteen non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were studied, of whom 91 had either a current foot ulcer or a history of foot ulceration. Foot ulcer patients had much higher pressure perception thresholds at the hallux than those without foot ulcers (mean +/- SE 4.63 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.54 +/- 0.04 U, P less than 0.001). The magnitude of association was higher than that for vibration thresholds and markedly greater than those for cool and warm thresholds. Pressure thresholds were highly accurate for identifying foot ulcer patients. At a threshold level of 4.21 U, the sensitivity was 0.84, with a specificity of 0.96. At similar sensitivities for vibration and thermal thresholds, specificities were lower. Foot ulceration and cutaneous pressure perception threshold are strongly associated. Pressure-threshold measurements are extremely accurate and perform at least as well as other quantitative sensory tests in identifying foot ulcer patients. Assessment of the foot pressure threshold may have promise as a simple and inexpensive method for detecting diabetic patients at risk for foot ulcers."}

In the second period, one group of children adjusted insulin dosage by computer algorithms, whereas the other continued to use manual methods. In the third period, both groups again adjusted insulin by traditional methods. Mean premeal glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin levels did not change in either group throughout the study. During the second period, episodes of hypoglycemia were more frequent in children without the computer than in those who used the device.

MaxEPA supplementation was associated with a significant fall in total triglycerides (P less than 0.001) but did not affect total cholesterol (P = 0.7) compared with control treatment. Fasting plasma glucose increased after 3 wk (P = 0.01) but not after 6 wk (P = 0.17) treatment with MaxEPA.

An increase in clotting factor VII (P = 0.02), without changes in fibrinogen or factor X levels, occurred in the MaxEPA group. Similar reductions in blood pressure were observed in both groups. Dietary supplementation with MaxEPA capsules (10 g/day) in NIDDM subjects is associated with improvement in hypertriglyceridemia but with deleterious effects in factor VII and blood glucose levels. Most indices of platelet function are unaffected by this therapy."}

Of the 122 adults greater than 17 yr of age who participated (95% response rate), 11.5% had diabetes, 7.4% had IGT, and the remaining 81.1% had normal glucose tolerance. Both diabetes and IGT were strongly age related. This high frequency of diabetes occurred, despite the population being relatively lean. Although the body mass index (BMI) increased with age in both men and women, only 25% of the population overall had BMI greater than 25 kg/m2. There were wide ranges of insulin responses to glucose, with the upper tertile of 2-h insulin levels being more than seven times higher than the lower tertile (144 +/- 13 vs. 19 +/- 1 mU/L). Hyperinsulinemia was associated with IGT, elevated triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Lipid abnormalities were much more frequent among men than women. Cholesterol levels were an average of 0.55 mM higher and triglycerides an average of 1.05 mM higher in men than in women, and both increased with age. In conclusion, this small isolated Aboriginal population from northern Australia had an unexpectedly high frequency of diabetes (in view of their relative leanness) in association with a high frequency of metabolic abnormalities indicative of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia, IGT, hypertriglyceridemia)."}

Two thousand two hundred seventy-three Pima Indians (949 men, 1324 women) aged greater than or equal to 15 yr from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona were examined between 1983 and 1989. Periodontal disease was diagnosed by tooth loss and by percentage of interproximal crestal alveolar bone loss ascertained from panoramic radiography. Subjects with little or no evidence of periodontal disease were classified as nondiseased. Thus, the incidence of advanced periodontal disease was determined. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of periodontal disease at first dental examination was 60% in subjects with NIDDM and 36% in those without. Twenty-two new cases developed in a subset of 701 subjects (272 men, 429 women) aged 15-54 yr who initially had little or no evidence of periodontal disease and had at least one additional dental examination. The incidence of periodontal disease in this group was similar in men and women (incidence-rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.5-1.9, controlled for age and diabetes). Higher age predicted a greater incidence of periodontal disease (chi 2 = 30.6, df = 3, P less than 0.001, controlled for sex and diabetes). The rate of periodontal disease in subjects with diabetes was 2.6 times (95% Cl 1.0-6.6, controlled for age and sex) that observed in those without. Although periodontal disease was common in nondiabetic Pima Indians, in whom most of the incident cases occurred, diabetes clearly conferred a substantially increased risk. Thus, periodontal disease should be considered a nonspecific complication of NIDDM."}

A complex survey design was used to select a probability sample of subjects from each location. A total of 4577 women were recruited, of whom 3057 underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation for the presence of diabetes mellitus. Women were classified as to their glucose tolerance based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test or previous physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus combined with current use of hypoglycemic medication.

Fasting plasma glucose increased linearly with increasing number of live births (coefficient 0.009, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.006-0.012), as did the 2-h value (coefficient 0.015, 95% CI 0.009-0.021). Adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), education, and income substantially reduced the magnitude of the association between childbearing and either plasma glucose measurement. When the prevalence of NIDDM in relation to childbearing was examined with logistic regression analysis, a significant linear increase in diabetes prevalence was seen with increasing number of live births (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs. 0 = 1.73, 95% CI 1.39-2.15), but adjustment for age, BMI, education, and income greatly reduced the magnitude of this association (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs. 0 = 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

One patient withdrew because of constipation. At randomization and after 3 mo of treatment, patients were given a standard mixed-test-meal tolerance test (MTT; 500 cal) after an overnight fast, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, metabolite, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and triglyceride concentrations were measured at 15- to 30-min intervals. Serum lipid, HbA1, and fructosamine concentrations were measured at monthly intervals. Glucose, NEFA, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower throughout the second MTT in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.01-0.001) but not in the placebo group. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels, but not postprandial concentrations, were reduced only in bezafibrate patients (P less than 0.05).

There were no changes in serum lipid concentrations in the placebo group. Treatment of patients with moderately controlled NIDDM with bezafibrate improves glucose tolerance and the serum lipid profile.

Differences were diminished or absent with AER less than 20 micrograms/min. Sensitivity, specificity, and prediction rates of AER in different specimens were evaluated against 24-h AER. Use of albumin concentrations and albumin-creatinine ratios did not improve test performance in comparison with AER. Sampling time and the overall rate of AER influenced measurement of urinary albumin excretion. Day or 24-h AER is most useful to determine the presence of abnormal AER. AER and albumin concentration in spot samples are of limited use for initial screening and frequently require day or 24-h specimens of AER for confirmation.

Diabetes mellitus is also mentioned as a risk factor in most clinical studies, making up 3-14% of the patients studied. Even in recent studies, diabetes mellitus is only preceded as a risk factor by cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disorders. To what extent cardiovascular disease and old age contribute to the increased influenza mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients remains unclear. The influence of epidemic influenza on the incidence of diabetic acidosis in combination with an impaired immune response to both Staphylococcus aureus and the influenza virus suggests that diabetes mellitus itself is the main risk factor. It is concluded that all patients with diabetes mellitus should receive annual vaccinations and that, in official recommendations, patients with diabetes mellitus should be mentioned as a separate risk group. Whole-virus vaccines are preferred over subunit vaccines."}

Many people have difficulty following this recommendation. Because patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes do not need overall calorie restriction, there is no caloric reason to restrict sucrose. In this study, we looked at the effect of the isocaloric substitution of a piece of chocolate cake for a baked potato in a mixed meal to determine whether this would increase the blood glucose in patients with type I diabetes. The glucose response to a cake-added meal was significantly greater than to a standard meal. The glucose response was no different between a cake-substitution meal and a standard meal. The reproducibility studies showed no difference between repeated standard meals. The urinary glucose excretion was significantly greater after a cake-added meal but was no different with the other pairs. There were no significant differences in the counterregulatory hormone responses at baseline between any of the paired studies. In conclusion, patients with type I diabetes may substitute a sucrose-containing dessert for another carbohydrate in their diet without compromising their postprandial glucose response. These data suggest that a dessert exchange may be helpful and not harmful in the management of diabetic patients. There is an inherent variability (at least 16%) in an insulin-requiring patient's response to a meal, making self-monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of insulin doses necessary to achieve near euglycemia."}

Why, which, and how?", ".U": "91005707", ".W": "Although controversies remain as to the usefulness of sulfonylureas, most evidence is in favor of their use in many if not patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. When used properly, sulfonylureas improve insulin secretion and action, and these effects may be maintained for years. If combined with hypocaloric dietary regulation, rapid- and short-acting sulfonylureas may help patients reach and maintain euglycemia without provoking chronic hyperinsulinemia or weight increase. There is no evidence that sulfonylurea treatment causes beta-cell exhaustion; instead, the antihyperglycemic effect helps improve beta-cell function. Sulfonylurea \"failures\" are often dietary failures or may be due to late introduction of these drugs, i.e., when beta-cell function is already attenuated. Desensitization of the insulinotropic effect of sulfonylureas may occur but might be avoided by discontinuous (less than 24 h/day) sulfonylurea exposure, i.e., once-daily administration of a short-acting sulfonylurea in a moderate dose. The most important adverse effect of sulfonylureas is long-lasting hypoglycemia, which may lead to permanent neurological damage and even death. This is mainly seen in elderly subjects who are exposed to some intercurrent event, e.g., acute energy deprivation or a drug interaction, i.e., aspirin. Long-acting sulfonylureas may be more likely to promote long-lasting hypoglycemia. The dose-response relationships of sulfonylureas have been poorly investigated, and sulfonylurea therapy should always be initiated and maintained at the lowest possible dose."}

The radioligand used was [3H]glipizide (9 Ci/mmol). The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel."}

Patients were studied before and 3 mo after the addition of acarbose to their treatment program, and a significant improvement in glycemic control was noted. Although the decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration was modest (12.0 +/- 0.8 to 10.8 +/- 0.3 mM), average postprandial plasma glucose concentration decreased by 3.4 mM. When acarbose therapy was discontinued in 5 patients, plasma glucose levels rapidly returned toward pretreatment levels. In addition to the improvement in glycemia, acarbose treatment also led to a significant reduction in HbA1c (7.4 +/- 0.2 to 6.4 +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.01) and triglyceride (2.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 mM, P less than 0.01) concentrations. Neither the plasma insulin response to meals nor insulin-stimulated glucose uptake improved with acarbose therapy, consistent with the view that acarbose improves glycemic control by delaying glucose absorption. Considerable individual variation was noted in the response to acarbose, and the results in 4 patients were dramatic, with striking reductions in both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. The addition of acarbose to patients with NIDDM not well controlled by sulfonylureas appears to have significant clinical benefit."}

The rationale for the use of this combination is based on the different sites of action of the two kinds of drugs and the possibility for obtaining additive or potentiating effects and reduced side effects. The clinical usefulness of chlorpropamide and glyburide in combination with metformin has been demonstrated in some clinical trials. The combination may provide satisfactory glycemic control for several years, and possibly insulin therapy can be postponed or even avoided. No special safety problems are encountered with the use of the combination other than those attributed to the use of metformin or sulfonylurea alone, i.e., lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia, respectively. The lethality risks of these associated conditions are comparable. It is concluded that more data are needed to evaluate the full clinical potential and the mechanism of action of oral combination therapy."}

Although several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of such therapy in NIDDM patients, the average effect is small and is observed in only about half of the patients. However, there are several problems with most previous studies, including small sample size, selection of patients, and simultaneous use of several end points. First, residual beta-cell function has been considered to be a prerequisite for a beneficial effect of combination therapy. Therefore, most studies have failed to demonstrate improved glycemic control after adding sulfonylurea to insulin therapy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Inclusion of patients with impaired beta-cell function will therefore attenuate the effect of combination therapy. Second, most studies have used glycemic control as an end point. Nevertheless, the insulin dose has been reduced by 20-30% to avoid hypoglycemia after adding sulfonylurea to insulin. Thus, the comparison has been made between treatments with a smaller insulin dose with sulfonylurea and a larger insulin dose without sulfonylurea. The patient most likely to benefit from combination therapy is slightly obese, has had NIDDM for a relatively short period, and has preserved beta-cell function. In such a patient, combined insulin-sulfonylurea therapy predominantly stimulates basal insulin secretion, resulting in more effective suppression of hepatic glucose production and lower fasting plasma glucose. The side effects are few, most notably more frequent but mild hypoglycemic reactions."}

Already in this phase, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and many IGT subjects, like NIDDM patients, often display several of the metabolic and circulatory disturbances that are associated with hyperglycemia, e.g., insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperproinsulinemia, delayed insulin release, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Therefore, and because untreated hyperglycemia is a self-perpetuating condition, early detection and early intervention may be necessary to prevent the progression and complications of NIDDM. This in turn would necessitate screening procedures, and the therapeutic goal should include both euglycemia and normalization of plasma insulin, plasma lipids, and blood pressure. A study in the German Democratic Republic indicated that the mortality in screening-detected NIDDM patients did not differ from that in patients detected in routine care. In a Swedish study on screening-detected NIDDM subjects, only those who had IGT rather than manifest NIDDM could maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for 5 yr by hypocaloric dietary regulation alone. In those with screening-detected NIDDM, the delayed acute insulin release and net postprandial hyperglycemia were improved by addition of glipizide, and most managed to attain and maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for approximately 2 yr after such addition. However, after 4 yr, there was an increase in blood glucose, suggesting that preventive intervention either may not be possible or may have to start in the IGT phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

One hypothesis postulates that these agents act, at the level of the plasma membrane, by causing the closure of a class of K+ channels characterized by their sensitivity to ATP. This may lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane, gating of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, increase in cytosolic Ca2+ activity, and activation of the effector system for insulin release. However, it is not evident that the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels accounts for effects of sulfonylureas such as inhibition of K+ inflow into the islet cells, increase in their Na+ content, or even stimulation of Ca2+ inflow and insulin release at physiological or higher concentrations of D-glucose."}

Nearly two thirds of patients with SD attempt suicide, but few complete it; however, completions may be more common than formerly realized. There is no specific treatment for SD, but management can be organized around the following ABCs: Accommodate initially to forge rapport; Behavior modification (ignore symptoms, praise for improved behavior); Confrontation later about effects of behavior style; Decrease drugs gradually, with praise for reduction; Educate about course and meaning of illness; Family involvement to give information and help with treatment; Guilt should be assuaged in physicians, who may blame themselves when patients do not improve; Hospitalize (closed psychiatric unit) only for serious suicide risk, substance abuse, or other extreme behavior; and Intercurrent depression should be treated conservatively."}

There are few, if any, recent reports on masculinization of a female fetus born to a mother who took an OC containing 1 mg of a progestogen during early pregnancy. However, patients suspected of being pregnant and who are desirous of continuing that pregnancy should not continue to take OCs, nor should progestogen withdrawal pregnancy tests be used. Concern still exists regarding the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in babies born to such women. The incidence of postoperative infection after first trimester therapeutic abortion in this country is low. However, increasing numbers of women are undergoing repeated pregnancy terminations, and their risk for subsequent pelvic infections may be multiplied with each succeeding abortion. The incidence of prematurity due to cervical incompetence or surgical infertility after first trimester pregnancy terminations is not increased significantly. Asherman's syndrome may occur after septic therapeutic abortion. The pregnancy rate after treatment of this syndrome is low. The return of menses and the achievement of a pregnancy may be slightly delayed after OCs are discontinued, but the fertility rate is within the normal range by 1 year. The incidence of postpill amenorrhea of greater than 6 months' duration is probably less than 1%. The occurrence of the syndrome does not seem to be related to length of use or type of pill. Patients with prior normal menses as well as those with menstrual abnormalities before use of OCs may develop this syndrome. Patients with normal estrogen and gonadotropin levels usually respond with return of menses and ovulation when treated with clomiphene. The rate for achievement of pregnancy is much lower than that for patients with spontaneous return of menses. The criteria for defining PID or for categorizing its severity are diverse. The incidence of PID is higher among IUD users than among patients taking OCs or using a barrier method. The excess risk of PID among IUD users, with the exception of the first few months after insertion, is related to sexually transmitted diseases and not the IUD. Women with no risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases have little increased risk of PID or infertility associated with IUD use. There appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users. All present methods of contraception entail some risk to the patient. The risk of imparied future fertility with the use of any method appears to be low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

Follicular fluid levels, E2, and androgens did not vary with DEX treatment, whereas cortisol levels markedly decreased and P levels increased with the treatment. These findings suggest that glucocorticosteroids can directly influence granulosa luteinized cell function."}

Although only 61% (16/26) of the diploid embryos resulting from partial zona dissection cleaved, the embryonic morphology of these embryos was comparable with controls. No pregnancies resulted from the transfer of manipulated embryos.

Transfers of embryos originating from donated oocytes took place after administrating oral estradiol (E2) valerate and vaginal micronized progesterone (P) following a regimen designed to mimic the serum levels of E2 and P observed during the menstrual cycle. Transfers of embryos originating from regular IVF took place either in the natural cycle (53 transfers) or after suppressing ovarian function with a single injection of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), Decapeptyl-Retard 3.75 mg, and administering the same hormone replacement regimen (E2/P) used in oocyte donation (65 transfers). Eighteen transfers involving 24 embryos originating from donated oocytes were affected, resulting in six pregnancies (4 ongoing). The ongoing pregnancy rate per transfer was 22%. Seventy-nine embryos originating from regular IVF were transferred (53 transfers) in the natural cycle resulting in six pregnancies (2 ongoing). One hundred three other embryos originating from regular IVF were transferred (65 transfers) after administration of GnRH-a and E2/P resulting in four pregnancies. The pregnancy rate after transfers of embryos originating from regular IVF was 9% per transfer.

Despite the abnormal midpiece architecture, the movement characteristics of the spermatozoa, in terms of the curvilinear, path, and progressive velocities, amplitude of head displacement, and hyperactivation were all within the normal range. Similarly, the behavior of the spermatozoa on Percoll gradients was normal, although the capacity of the isolated fractions to generate reactive oxygen species was negligible. Of particular significance was the fact that the globozoospermic spermatozoa were incapable of sperm-oocyte fusion or binding the human zona pellucida, even after an intracellular calcium signal had been generated with the ionophore A23187. The sudden induction of sperm-zona interaction could, however, be achieved by the use of a ferrous ion promoter system to induce limited lipoperoxidation. This result demonstrates that the enhancing effect of peroxidation on sperm-zona adhesion involves a direct action on the properties of the sperm-plasma membrane, rather than an indirect consequence of acrosomal damage and acrosin leakage. Such findings emphasize the value of specific teratozoospermic conditions, such as globozoospermia, in dissecting the mechanisms that regulate human sperm function."}

A prospective randomized study will be undertaken to evaluate whether the use of fibrin sealant could significantly improve IVF and ET results."}

Possible implications for future treatment of diabetes.", ".U": "91006859", ".W": "Vanadate ions, low-molecular-weight phosphate analogues, mimic most of the rapid actions of insulin in various cell types. When administered orally to diabetic hyperglycemic rats, vanadate reaches the circulation, mimics insulin stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism, and leads to normoglycemic and partial anabolic states. In addition, vanadate restores tissue responsiveness to insulin and hepatic glycogen levels and activates new synthesis of key enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism. This suggests that correcting hyperglycemia is sufficient to correct the typical metabolic alterations found in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Several weeks of oral administration of vanadate to diabetic rats has not produced detectable liver or kidney toxicity. The mechanism by which vanadate mimics the actions of insulin is still obscure. Unlike insulin, vanadate does not seem to stimulate the autophosphorylation and endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-receptor kinase or other intracellular proteins either directly or by virtue of its known inhibitory effect on protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase. Results from many studies support a model in which vanadate activates glucose metabolism by either utilizing an alternative (insulin-independent) cascade or bypassing the early events of the insulin-dependent cascade. Either of these possibilities is of clinical importance, because early insulin events may become defective, as a result of severe hyperinsulinemia, and may contribute to insulin resistance. Alternative pathways by which vanadate may stimulate glucose metabolism, e.g., by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels and/or regulating intracellular and intravesicular pH, are discussed. From a clinical perspective, studies should be continued in evaluating the level of vanadate toxicity after prolonged treatment and searching for agents that potentiate its insulin mimetic actions in vitro and in vivo."}

As part of a community-based study, we reexamined 146 second-generation Japanese-American men who had been initially classified as nondiabetic. At a mean follow-up period of 30 mo, 15 men had developed NIDDM, and 131 remained nondiabetic. The variables measured at the initial visit that distinguished the 15 diabetic men from the 131 nondiabetic men were older age, higher serum glucose level at 2 h after 75 g oral glucose, higher fasting plasma C-peptide level, and increased cross-sectional intra-abdominal fat area as determined by computed tomography. Both older age and higher 2-h glucose levels are variables that have been associated with the development of NIDDM, but the association of higher fasting C-peptide level and greater intra-abdominal fat area with subsequent development of NIDDM were new observations. The elevated fasting C-peptide level persisted after adjustment for fasting serum glucose. The elevated C-peptide level represents hypersecretion of insulin and was interpreted to reflect a compensatory response to an underlying insulin-resistant state that antedates the development of NIDDM. The fasting C-peptide level was correlated with the intra-abdominal fat area, suggesting that the intra-abdominal fat area may be associated with insulin resistance. Thus, in individuals who develop NIDDM, insulin resistance, increased insulin secretion, and increased intra-abdominal fat are present before diabetic glucose tolerance can be demonstrated."}

Insulin secretion was evaluated for pulsatility with the Clifton Cycle Detection Program. Perifusion of islets was associated with a spontaneous, persistent, and regular pulsatility of insulin secretion, which was observed in all conditions tested. Perifusion with medium containing 5.5 mM glucose (n = 11) demonstrated oscillations with a mean periodicity of 17.6 +/- 1.1 min and a mean amplitude of 4.8 +/- 0.4 microU/ml when overall mean insulin concentration was 16.7 +/- 2.4 microU/ml. When the glucose concentration was 16.7 mM (n = 9), overall mean insulin concentration was 54.4 +/- 2.6 microU/ml, with increases in periodicity (22.0 +/- 1.3 min) and amplitude (10.7 +/- 0.5 microU/ml).

However, the intracellular metabolic fate of glucose may not be the same when glucose uptake is stimulated predominantly by either of these mechanisms due to different effects on fat oxidation (Fox). To address this issue, 11 healthy subjects each had four glucose-clamp studies performed in combination with indirect calorimetry to compare Gox, Nox, and Fox at two different rates of glucose uptake (approximately 7 and 10 mg.kg-1 fat-free mass [FFM].min-1) matched at each level by either hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. When glucose uptake was matched at the lower rate (7 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1), there was less suppression of both FFA (33 vs. 43%, P less than 0.05) and Fox (73 vs. 90%, P less than 0.05) and less stimulation of incremental (above basal) Gox (1.95 vs. 2.49 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, P less than 0.025) at low insulin (72 pM) and hyperglycemia (21.8 mM) compared with high insulin (280 pM) and euglycemia (5.1 mM). Matching glucose uptake at the higher rates (10 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1) required greater than 300 pM of insulin (309 and 632 pM) in both studies and resulted in maximal suppression of FFA (49 vs. 46%, NS) and Fox (both greater than 90%, NS) and similar incremental Gox (2.89 vs. 2.73 mg.kg-1 FFM.min-1, NS) whether at hyperglycemia (15.7 mM) or euglycemia (5.2 mM). Therefore, both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia stimulate glucose uptake and increase intracellular glucose availability, but insulin also regulates Gox by suppression of FFA and Fox. However, when FFA and Fox are maximally suppressed, the rate of glucose uptake, rather than the prevailing insulin level, determines the distribution of intracellular glucose metabolism."}

All diabetic subjects were studied while in poor metabolic control (fasting glucose 13.3 +/- 1.1 mM; HbA1c 10.8 +/- 0.2%) and again after 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy (fasting glucose 7.2 +/- 0.5 mM; HbA1c 8.0 +/- 0.2%). Insulin-mediated total-body glucose uptake in poorly controlled diabetic subjects (3.6 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was significantly reduced compared with control subjects (7.5 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .001) and improved slightly after insulin therapy (4.8 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .05), although it still remained significantly lower than in control subjects (P less than .01).

After 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy, the effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on ELF, LO, and NOLD was comparable to that of control subjects, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism was still impaired. To examine the effect of substrate availability on leucine turnover, well-regulated IDDM and control subjects underwent a repeat insulin-clamp study combined with a balanced amino acid infusion designed to increase circulating plasma amino acid levels approximately twofold. Under these conditions, NOLD was equally enhanced above baseline in both control and IDDM subjects (P less than .01), whereas ELF was inhibited to a greater extent (P less than .01) than during the insulin clamp performed without amino acid infusion (control vs. diabetic subjects, NS). In conclusion, insulin-mediated glucose metabolism is severely impaired in subjects with both poorly controlled and well-controlled IDDM, whereas the effect of acute insulin infusion on leucine turnover is normal, and combined hyperaminoacidemia/hyperinsulinemia stimulated NOLD to a similar extent in both IDDM and control subjects."}

The liver-type transporter is expressed in tissues from which a net release of glucose can occur and in beta-cells of pancreatic islets.

The addition of an intrahepatic arterial infusion of adenosine (10 mumol/min) during insulin infusion caused glucose output to return to basal levels (insulin, -1.7 +/- 2.6 mg.kg-1.min-1; insulin + adenosine, 3.8 +/- 1.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). The addition of intrahepatic arterial saline (control) during insulin infusion had no effect on insulin's action (insulin, -1.0 +/- 1.9 mg.kg-1.min-1; insulin + saline, -1.2 +/- 1.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, P greater than 0.05). Hepatic glucose, lactate, and oxygen deliveries were not affected during either insulin or insulin plus adenosine infusion. Intrahepatic arterial infusion of adenosine alone had no effect on NHGO, whereas intrahepatic arterial infusion of glucagon alone stimulated glucose output approximately fivefold (basal, 2.7 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1; glucagon, 15.5 +/- 1.2 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). These results show that adenosine completely reversed the inhibition by insulin of NHGO. These data suggest that adenosine may act as a modulator of insulin action on the liver."}

Adult and fetal rat islets were cultured in medium with 2.7 or 16.7 mM glucose or 16.7 mM glucose and 1 microgram/ml human growth hormone. In both types of islets, 16.7 mM glucose doubled [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with 2.7 mM glucose, and the addition of growth hormone caused a further increase in DNA replication. TK activity in the islets showed similar changes in response to glucose and growth hormone. The correlation between [3H]thymidine incorporation and TK activity was thus highly significant. Cell-cycle analysis of cultured fetal rat islets showed that TK activity was preferentially expressed during the S phase of the cell cycle. TK activity of freshly isolated islets declined with the age of the animal. In pancreatic sections, the islet cell autoradiographic labeling index after [3H]thymidine administration in vivo likewise declined with age and was correlated with the TK activity in freshly isolated islets. It is suggested that measurements of islet TK activity can be used as index of islet cell proliferation; this method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the cumbersome procedure of preparing and scoring autoradiograms."}

By day 90, plasma renin and prorenin became elevated, and arterial pressure declined. Transglomerular passage of dextrans of broad size distribution (radii 28-60 A) was lowered significantly. In a subset of 8 patients, withdrawal of enalapril was followed after an additional 30 days by a return of renin levels and arterial pressure to pretreatment levels. The dextran-sieving profile also returned to baseline, becoming uniformly elevated above treated day-90 levels. A theoretical analysis of the serial dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to smaller size. These changes in barrier size selectivity were associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and IgG clearances during enalapril therapy and a subsequent rise in these quantities after its withdrawal; urinary protein excretion rate tended to vary in parallel. We conclude that inhibition of converting enzyme in humans with established diabetic glomerulopathy diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins by enhancing barrier size selectivity. Because neither enalapril therapy nor its withdrawal influenced the glomerular filtration or renal plasma flow rates significantly, we propose that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier."}

No significant glomerular thrombi were seen in the nondiabetic control animals, whereas the severity of glomerular thrombi in the diabetic animals was dependent on the presence or absence of CsA, endotoxin dose, and degree of glycemic control. In the diabetic rats, glomerular thrombi occurred maximally at 4 h but were no longer present at 24 h. The CsA/high-dose-endotoxin rats had fewer glomerular thrombi than rats receiving the intralipid/high-dose endotoxin, but this difference was not statistically significant. The CsA/low-dose-endotoxin rats had increased glomerular thrombi compared with the intralipid/low-dose-endotoxin rats (P less than 0.01). Insulin treatment reduced the glomerular capillary thrombi in the CsA/low-dose-endotoxin diabetic animals. Thus, CsA aggravates the GSR with low-dose endotoxin but has no significant effect when high-dose endotoxin is given. Improved glycemic control reduces the GSR in CsA-treated rats. Thus, the interrelationships of diabetes, endotoxin, and CsA on the GSR are complex, and the pathogenesis of these events is unclear."}

Sequence determination and oligonucleotide hybridization was carried out on enzymatically amplified DNA from various HLA-DR-typed individuals, including the rare class of DR2+ patients. In the analysis of DQ beta variation in DR4, DRw6, and DR2 haplotypes, a correlation was observed between the presence of the negatively charged residue Asp at position 57 and low susceptibility and the presence of an Ala (DR4), Val (DRw6), or Ser (DR2) and higher susceptibility. However, important exceptions to this pattern have been identified in the analysis of heterozygous DR1/4 IDDM patients. In these individuals, susceptibility appears to correlate with specific DR beta l alleles (Dw4) on the DR4 haplotype, rather than with the DQ beta allele (DQB3.2) that contains Ala at position 57. The DQ beta alleles found in some Chinese IDDM patients also proved discordant with the position-57 correlations. Thus, although there is a general correlation between the residue at position 57 of the DQ beta-chain and IDDM susceptibility, these data do not support the notion that Asp 57 confers complete resistance or protection to IDDM. In general, these results suggest that IDDM susceptibility is conferred by specific combinations of DQ beta and DR beta sequences."}

Some genes are highly associated with IDDM, other genes are associated with resistance to IDDM, and some highly associated susceptibility genes are markedly influenced by trans-associated synergistic effects (DR3/4 heterozygotes) or protective effects (DR2/4 heterozygotes). This plethora of genetic associations has spawned the notion that there are many contributing susceptibility genes, which, in turn, has led to the search for shared structural features among different genes on IDDM-associated haplotypes. From a more mechanistic point of view, however, the wide range of variable IDDM associations, with both cis- and trans-encoded protective and/or synergistic effects, suggests a different approach. This article proposes a hypothesis in which the different HLA associations with IDDM can be simply explained by a single unifying concept: a hierarchy of affinities determines the interaction between a diabetogenic peptide and different class II molecules, and an individual is susceptible to IDDM if the class II molecule in that individual with the highest affinity for such a peptide is a DQ beta susceptibility gene. The explicit formulation of this proposal and its genetic implications provide an explanation for HLA-encoded dominant \"protection\" and for some of the more subtle genetic observations related to cis and trans influences in IDDM susceptibility."}

Two consistent differences in subfraction composition were noted between the diabetic patients at entry and the control subjects. First, subfractions from diabetic patients tended to be cholesterol-ester poor and triglyceride rich; this was particularly marked for the low-density lipoprotein subfractions. Second, the subfractions from pretreatment diabetic patients contained higher proportions of non-apolipoprotein B apolipoproteins. This compositional anomaly, but not the lipid modifications, responded to but was not completely normalized by improved glycemic control, which was also accompanied by reductions in the plasma concentrations of all subfractions. Treatment modified subfraction distribution so that the lipoprotein profile of posttreatment diabetic patients more closely resembled the profile observed in the control subjects. These changes were achieved without significant modification of daily insulin dose. In the context of blood lipid risk factors, the results argue for the need to maintain optimal insulinization even in apparently normolipidemic diabetic patients to avoid modifications of the lipoprotein pattern toward a potentially more atherogenic profile."}

Insulin release increased 10-fold in response to the higher glucose concentration, and dot-blot analysis of islet mRNA with a rat preproinsulin cDNA probe showed a concomitant increase in mRNA levels. The globulin fractions of four test serums, three from patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes and one from a patient with the insulin autoimmune syndrome, showed clear (5- to 8-fold) stimulation of insulin release. The nonglobulin fractions of these serums and both fractions of three control serums failed to stimulate secretion of insulin. The insulin mRNA content of islets incubated with the ICSTA globulin fractions was greatly increased compared with levels observed in islets treated with control serum globulin fractions.

Treatment of pancreatic islets with CHX at concentrations (0-5 mM) that caused a dose-dependent inactivation of glucokinase activity similarly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion. Another glucose-phosphorylating enzyme (hexokinase) in pancreatic islets was little affected by CHX. CHX-induced inactivation of glucokinase was blocked by the presence of its substrates (glucose and mannose) and an inhibitor (N-acetylglucosamine), all of which also protected against the inhibitory effect of the drug on glucose-induced insulin secretion. CHX also impaired insulin secretion induced by D-glyceraldehyde and dimethyl succinate, which are believed to stimulate the release of the hormone by being directly oxidized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, by entering the midstream of the glycolytic pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, or by entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria after intracellular hydrolysis. The inhibitory effect of CHX on glucose-induced insulin secretion, however, was far more marked than that on insulin secretion evoked by D-glyceraldehyde and dimethyl succinate at any CHX concentrations used. Our study revealed that the inhibitory action of CHX on glucose-induced insulin secretion is exerted mainly, but not solely, through inactivation of glucokinase. This conclusion supports the view that glucokinase is a key enzyme in the recognition of glucose as an insulin secretagogue in pancreatic islets."}

When FRBCs were incubated in vitro in different glucose concentrations to study their capacity to compensate for changes in plasma glucose concentration, younger cells showed better glucose-buffering capacities. Glucose and glycogen levels in FRBCs increased when they were incubated in high-glucose medium, and the glycogen concentration reached was higher in the early fetal stage than by the end of gestation. Nevertheless, adult erythrocytes accumulated more glycogen in high-glucose medium than cells from any of the fetal-aged erythrocytes. When glucose was injected intraperitoneally into fetuses of different ages, there was an increase of 3.7 microM/ml in glucose concentration in blood from the umbilical artery and 2.5 microM/ml in blood from the umbilical vein. FRBCs buffered some of this change, as evident by an increase in glycogen content. Again, buffering capacity was greater for erythrocytes in younger fetuses.

Administration of englitazone at 5-50 mg.kg-1.day-1 lowered plasma glucose and insulin dose dependently without producing frank hypoglycemia in either the diabetic or nondiabetic lean animals. The glucose-lowering effect in ob/ob mice preceded the reduction in hyperinsulinemia. On cessation of drug, plasma insulin returned to untreated levels within 48 h, whereas plasma glucose rose slowly over 5 days. Englitazone (50 mg/kg) for 11 days lowered plasma glucose (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 14.0 +/- 1.9 mM), insulin (7.57 +/- 0.67 to 1.64 +/- 0.60 nM), nonesterified fatty acids (1813 +/- 86 to 914 +/- 88 microM), glycerol (9.20 +/- 0.98 to 4.94 +/- 0.03 mM), triglycerides (1.99 +/- 0.25 to 1.03 +/- 0.11 g/L), and cholesterol (6.27 +/- 0.96 to 3.87 +/- 0.57 mM), but no effects were observed 3 h after a single dose. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis were enhanced in adipocytes from ob/ob mice treated with 50 mg/kg englitazone for 11 days compared with lipogenesis in cells from vehicle-treated controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with 50 mg/kg englitazone reversed the defects in insulin-stimulated glycolysis (from [3-3H]glucose) and glycogenesis and basal glucose oxidation (from [1-14C]glucose) in isolated soleus muscles. Englitazone (30 microM) stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes from 0.37 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.06 and 1.53 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Thus, englitazone has 1) insulinomimetic and insulin-enhancing actions in vitro and 2) glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride-, and cholesterol-lowering properties in an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in which sulfonylureas have little or no effect. Thus, this new agent may have beneficial effects including a reduced risk of hypoglycemia in patients with NIDDM."}

HDL3 was glycosylated in vitro with glucose alone or in combination with sodium cyanoborohydride. With this catalyst, up to 40-50% of the lysine residues could be glycosylated, resulting in a progressive drop to nearly 60% in high-affinity binding to cultured fibroblasts at 4 degrees C. Binding to the 110,000-Mr candidate HDL-receptor protein was reduced by almost 75%. At levels of HDL glycosylation equivalent to the 3-5% observed in diabetes, high-affinity binding to fibroblasts at 4 degrees C was diminished by up to 15-20%.

The findings in this study suggest that nonenzymatically glycosylated HDL may be functionally abnormal and might contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus."}

We report a 2-yr analysis of the response to cyclosporin A in the group of 81 patients included in the initial study. As observed before, a remission could be obtained in most of the patients (65%) in association with a shorter duration of symptoms, less severe hyperglycemia, lower incidence of ketoacidosis, and higher plasma C-peptide concentrations. All remissions ended during the follow-up period after a mean +/- SE duration of 316 +/- 21 days (range 31-850 days). Two parameters were linked to the duration of remissions: the mean circulating level of cyclosporin during the first 3 mo and the duration of prediagnostic polyuria. We were unable to relate the end of a remission to variations in the cyclosporin regimen, titer of autoantibodies, or progression of beta-cell failure. The euglycemic clamp technique revealed that insulin sensitivity decreases with time in patients not taking insulin. At 24 mo, the patients who had a remission of insulin dependency had better glycemic control, lower insulin dosages, and C-peptide levels two- to threefold higher than the nonremission patients and four- to sixfold higher than the historical control subjects. The cyclosporin regimen was well tolerated over the observed period: more specifically, serum creatinine remained unchanged, and kidney biopsies performed at 18-24 mo of treatment were within normal limits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Syngeneic neonatal pancreases were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the NOD mice at 21 wk of age. Silica treatment was continued until 24 wk of age, and then the mice were killed for examination of islet morphology. Neither the islets in transplanted pancreases nor the host pancreatic islets from the early long-term silica-treated animals revealed insulitis. In contrast, most of the islets in transplanted pancreases from the late short-term silica-treated animals showed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis, as did the host islets. A further experiment was performed to compare the effect of late short-term silica treatment with that of anti-L3T4-antibody treatment of the same time and duration. In contrast to the late short-term silica-treated animals, the transplanted pancreases in the anti-L3T4-antibody-treated animals revealed intact islets, although most of the host islets showed insulitis. The control group, which received no treatment but did receive neonatal pancreases, revealed severe insulitis and beta-cell necrosis of both transplanted and host islets. These results suggest that early macrophage depletion can abolish the development of beta-cell-specific immunologic effectors but that late macrophage depletion, after the development of insulitis, does not affect the destruction of beta-cells by preexisting effectors other than macrophages. We conclude that macrophages are essential for the development of beta-cell-specific cytotoxic effectors in the initial phase of insulitis in NOD mice."}

In these studies, PI-phospholipase C (PLC) treatment of lymphocytes from BB and normal rats followed by immunoabsorption and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of released proteins with anti-RT6 allotype-specific monoclonal antibodies was performed. RT6.1 in several nondiabetic rat strains was found to consist of a family of nonglycosylated and variably glycosylated molecules: an N-Glycanase-resistant 24,000- to 26,000-Mr peptide and four N-Glycanase-sensitive peptides of 29,000, 31,000, 33,000, and 34,000 Mr. In contrast, RT6.2 was found to be a 24,000- to 26,000-Mr nonglycosylated polypeptide.

A pattern of bands characteristic of the RT6.1 antigen found in normal rat strains was detected after PLC treatment or detergent solubilization of lymphocytes obtained from DR rats. In contrast, no evidence of either RT6 species was found after PLC or detergent treatment of comparable numbers of T lymphocytes from DP-BB rats. Interestingly, T lymphocytes from Wistar-Furth (RT6.2+) x DP (RT6-) F1 crosses were observed to coexpress both RT6.2 and RT6.1 molecules, with the electrophoretic pattern of RT6.1 being similar to that obtained in DR and other rat strains.

In recombinant strains, those with the same haplotypes on the K, E, S, and D subregions of the H-2 complex showed undefined (high and low) susceptibilities, indicating that the diabetes-susceptibility genes are located outside these loci.

In addition, administration of anti-I-A monoclonal antibody prevented the manifestation of diabetes in STZ-administered mice. Passive transfer of STZ-administered T lymphocytes to mice given minute doses of STZ induced significant hyperglycemia. This successful transfer was only observed in H-2-compatible mice.

In 36 patients (81.8%), no relation with an esophageal abnormality could be established, either because the patients had no pain during the 24-hour study, or because the pain seemed unrelated to reflux or abnormal motility."}

Simultaneous esophageal manometric, pH, and crural diaphragm electromyogram recordings were performed for 1 hour in the postprandial period. Swallow-induced lower esophageal sphincter relaxation was associated with minimal inhibition of the crural diaphragm, but transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation was accompanied by marked inhibition of the crural diaphragm. The degree of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation appeared to correlate with the degree of crural diaphragm inhibition during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Inhibition of crural diaphragm during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation may play an important role in facilitating flow across the gastroesophageal junction."}

This condition has been termed \"cricopharyngeal achalasia.\" The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenesis of cricopharyngeal bars. Concurrent videofluoroscopic and manometric examinations of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter were performed in a cohort of six patients with prominent cricopharyngeal bars and in eight control volunteers. In each subject, swallows of 2-30-mL barium boluses were recorded. The patients with cricopharyngeal bars showed (a) normal peristaltic contraction in the pharynx, (b) normal axial upper esophageal sphincter pressure and relaxation, (c) normal flow rate across the upper esophageal sphincter, and (d) normal duration of upper esophageal sphincter opening for different bolus volumes. The major abnormalities in the patients with cricopharyngeal bars were (a) reduced maximal dimensions of the upper esophageal sphincter during the transsphincteric flow of barium and (b) increased intrabolus pressure upstream to the upper esophageal sphincter. Thus, the increase in intrabolus pressure preserved normal transsphincteric flow rates even though the upper esophageal sphincter did not open normally. Overall, the constellation of findings in the patients studied suggests that the underlying pathogenesis of their cricopharyngeal bar was reduced muscle compliance wherein the relaxed cricopharyngeus did not distend normally during swallowing."}

Therefore, the gastric emptying rate of 50- and 200-mL volumes of phenol red solution were measured while monitoring contractile activity. Motor activity was recorded using a hydraulic manometric system and expressed as either the proximity of dosing time to time of appearance of phase III or as a motility index, defined as (contractile area)/(sampling interval time). After an initial lag period, emptying was log linear. With a 50-mL oral dose, the mean gastric emptying rate of the log-linear phase was successively faster during phase I (0.018 +/- 0.003 min-1), phase II (0.083 +/- 0.031 min-1), and late phase II/III (0.171 +/- 0.066 min-1) (P less than 0.05). Similarly, the mean lag time decreased successively with phases I, II, and late II/III (19.1 +/- 12.4, 7.6 +/- 5.6, and 3.8 +/- 2.8 minutes, respectively). At a 200-mL oral dose, there was no difference in the emptying rate between phase I and phase II (0.104 +/- 0.0014 vs. 0.110 +/- 0.041 min-1), but the emptying rate during late phase II/III was significantly greater (0.236 +/- 0.069 min-1); lag time was not dependent on phase. There was a statistical difference in the overall mean emptying rate between the 50- and 200-mL volumes. Also, during phase I, the emptying rate was faster for the 200-mL volume. This study shows a strong dependence of liquid gastric emptying rate and lag time on interdigestive antral motility, the emptying of small volumes being more dependent on motility phase than that of large volumes. Phase-related fluctuations in contractile activity can account for much of the reported variability in gastric emptying data. Furthermore, this study suggests that dose volume and interdigestive motor activity at the time of drug administration can affect absorption and onset of therapeutic response for some drugs."}

Because both peptides are found in variable concentrations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and pancreas, it has been contended that somatostatin-28 is either an intermediate in the processing to somatostatin-14 or a terminal product derived from prosomatostatin. To address this question, two antisera were used to recognize epitopes in two regions of somatostatin-14; one with high specificity for somatostatin-14 and the other interacting with prosomatostatin, somatostatin-28, and somatostatin-14. Distribution of these peptides was measured in extracts of pancreas and mucosa and submucosa/muscularis from the rat and human GI mucosal biopsies; the antisera were used to immunostain cells in these tissues. Extracts of human and rat intestinal mucosa contained both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. By immunocytochemistry, D cells in stomach and pancreas and neural processes in the intestine, extending into the mucosal villi adjacent to endocrine cells, stained with both antisera indicating the presence of somatostatin-14, prosomatostatin, and possibly somatostatin-28. In contrast, endocrine cells in the gut reacting with antisera against somatostatin-28 did not immunostain with somatostatin-14-specific antisera. Thus, these data suggest that somatostatin-28 is the terminal peptide processed from prosomatostatin in intestinal mucosal cells, whereas somatostatin-14 is the major final product in gastric and pancreatic D cells and neurons. The localization of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 in different cells in the pancreas and GI tract implies that they serve different functions."}

Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes."}

The stomachs were perfused by way of the celiac artery. On coinfusion of 1.0 mumol/L tetrodotoxin and 1 nmol/L bombesin, a significant depression in release of somatostatin was observed compared with that observed with bombesin alone. The 5-minute integrated somatostatin response after treatment with tetrodotoxin and bombesin was 173% +/- 14% of basal, which was significantly lower than that observed with bombesin alone (394% +/- 59% of basal, P less than 0.05) but significantly higher than that observed with medium-199 alone (95% +/- 7% of basal, P less than 0.05); this indicated that approximately 70% of the bombesin-stimulated somatostatin release was indirectly mediated through neural pathways, while a significant (approximately 30%) segment of it was mediated by nonneural mechanisms. To test if the 30% somatostatin release was secondary to gastrin release in response to bombesin, gastrin antiserum and bombesin (1 nmol/L) were coadministrated in the presence or absence of tetrodotoxin (1 mumol/L). Gastrin antiserum alone did not significantly affect basal release of somatostatin but caused a significant inhibition (approximately 23%) of bombesin-provoked somatostatin release. Coadministration of gastrin antiserum and tetrodotoxin attenuated bombesin-stimulated somatostatin release. Gastrin (1 mumol/L) alone significantly stimulated somatostatin release (150% +/- 10% of basal), which was completely attenuated in the presence of gastrin antiserum. Tetrodotoxin did not affect bombesin-elicited gastrin release, confirming that bombesin-stimulated gastrin release was directly mediated. To determine the nature of the neural pathways mediating the bombesin-induced somatostatin release, atropine (100 nmol/L) was used. Atropine inhibited bombesin-induced somatostatin release to the same extent as tetrodotoxin, indicating that cholinergic pathways mediated bombesin-induced somatostatin release. These results show that almost all the somatostatin response to bombesin is indirectly mediated, and is composed of a major neural (cholinergic) and a minor nonneural pathway. The nonneural mechanism appears to be contributed primarily by gastrin released in response to bombesin, which apparently has a short paracrine positive feedback effect on somatostatin release."}

Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive. Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied. Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species. Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied. Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related. Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined. Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis. All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa. Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour. Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples. In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels. The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes. These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel."}

Polyclonal antibodies to each of the three neurofilament subunits reliably stained myenteric neurons and their processes, indicating the presence of all three proteins in these cells. However, several well-characterized monoclonal antibodies to epitopes on high- and medium-molecular-weight subunits showed immunoreactivity in brain tissue but not in myenteric neurons and their processes. Some of the antibodies that do not stain recognize only phosphorylated epitopes, indicating that the level of neurofilament phosphorylation is very low in enteric neurons. Other antibodies that are not thought to be sensitive to the level of neurofilament phosphorylation show reduced or no staining of enteric neurons, suggesting the presence of immunologically distinct neurofilaments in these cells. These results suggest the presence of modified neurofilament structures in enteric neurons, possibly reflecting their unique mechanical character within the moving intestinal wall."}

Thus, the uptake of [14C]taurocholate by basal plasma membrane vesicles obtained from normal human term placentas was studied. Taurocholate retention into vesicles was studied using a rapid filtration technique that was modified to reduce the taurocholate binding to the filters and to the external surface of the vesicles. Using 100 mumol/L substrate, the membrane vesicles showed a temperature-dependent, Na(+)-independent transport of taurocholate into an osmotically reactive intravesicular space. The initial rate of taurocholate influx in the presence of 100 mmol/L KNO3 followed saturation kinetics (apparent Km for taurocholate = 670 +/- 128 mumol/L; Vmax = 1.86 +/- 0.28 nmol/mg protein.60 s at 37 degrees C). Over the 6.9-7.9 pH range neither internal nor external pH nor inward nor outward proton gradients affected the uptake of taurocholate. When the electrical potential difference across the basal membrane was manipulated by external anion replacement (Cl-, SCN-, SO4(2-), or NO3-) or by valinomycin-induced K(+)-diffusion potential (vesicle inside negative), taurocholate uptake was not significantly modified. Taurocholate uptake was cis-inhibited in the presence of 1 mmol/L glycocholate, 0.5 mmol/L 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate and 0.5 mmol/L sulfobromophthalein. However, 1 mmol/L probenecid or 0.5 mmol/L p-aminohippurate had no effect. Moreover, preloading the vesicles with 100 mmol/L HCO3- (but not with 100 mmol/L Cl- or 50 mmol/L SO4(2-) induced a significant enhancement in the initial rate of taurocholate uptake. In summary, these findings provide strong evidence for the presence of an electroneutral transport system for taurocholate in the basal plasma membrane of human chorionic trophoblast. They also suggest that this is likely to be an anion-exchange system."}

However, this organ is not a static reservoir. It actively modifies bile by two processes: concentration and acidification. This study was designed to simultaneously evaluate the relationship between these two physiological processes in the normal human gallbladder and to define their effects on biliary cholesterol and calcium solubility. Bile was sampled directly from the gallbladder of 78 morbidly obese patients undergoing elective gastric bypass procedures. All had negative results of intra-operative ultrasound examinations for sludge and gallstones, normal liver function tests, and no history of hepatobiliary disease. Bile salt concentrations, an indirect index of concentration by the gallbladder, ranged from 15.1-272.8 mmol/L. As [bile salt] increased, [Na+], [K+], free [Ca2+], [cholesterol], [phospholipid], and [total lipid] increased linearly; [Cl-1] decreased linearly. Molar percent cholesterol decreased from 17.2% in dilute bile to 10.1% in fully concentrated bile, suggesting that cholesterol was absorbed by the gallbladder. As bile was concentrated, cholesterol saturation index decreased curvilinearly from a maximum of 3.7 in dilute bile to 1.0-1.5 in concentrated bile. Concentration of gallbladder bile was accompanied by progressive acidification. Bile pH decreased linearly with increasing [bile salt]; [CO3(2-)] decreased curvilinearly. Despite increasing [Ca2+], CaCO3 saturation index decreased curvilinearly with increasing [bile salt] from a maximum of 3.62 in dilute bile to a minimum of 0.12 in concentrated and acidified bile. CaCO3 saturation index also decreased exponentially with decreasing pH. This study concludes that concentration of bile enhances cholesterol solubility while acidification enhances calcium salt solubility. By increasing the solubilities of these two species, gallbladder mucosal function may play a key role in preventing gallstone formation."}

Control prairie dogs were fed a trace-cholesterol diet and test animals were fed a high (1.2%)-cholesterol diet for 8 days. Although the proportion of beta-actin was unchanged, the proportion of alpha-actin in the gallbladder was less in the animals fed the high-cholesterol diet (32.6% +/- 1.5% in the control animals and 24.6% +/- 0.4% in the diet animals). On the other hand, the proportion of gamma-actin was significantly greater in the cholesterol-fed animals. There were no significant differences in the proportions of the myosin heavy-chain isoforms between the two groups. Also, there was no change in the volume fraction of smooth muscle in the gallbladders from the two groups. Thus, cholesterol feeding induces a shift in actin isoforms at the same time that there is a decrease in contractility. Whether the altered pattern of actin isoforms is related to the functional changes remains to be determined."}

Pressures obtained in vivo were always 15%-25% lower than those measured in vitro. The spatial distributions of the positive pressure in vivo and in vitro were almost identical. There was a high correlation between the pressures in vitro and in vivo (r = 0.88; P less than or equal to 0.01). This justifies assessment of shock-wave energies generated during biliary lithotripsy by extrapolation of in vitro data. It is concluded that it is possible to characterize different lithotriptors by in vitro pressure profile measurements."}

However, characteristic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography radiographic findings associated with malignant strictures are frequently not specific and cytological confirmation becomes essential for the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the current overall diagnostic yield of positive cytology in such circumstances ranges from 18%-56% depending on the technique. A new brush device has been designed which is uniquely adapted to pancreaticobiliary strictures of varying anatomical configurations. This study shows results using this new cytology brush in a series of 53 patients with pancreaticobiliary malignancy. A significant improvement in the cytological yield of tumor confirmation was obtained with a diagnostic sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% using the new brush technique."}

Before elective cholecystectomy, 25 patients had their common hepatic ducts' diameter measured by ultrasonography before and after a fat stimulus. In 23, tests were repeated 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery. In preoperative studies, 5 patients showed dilatation after fat and 2 of these had stones in the common bile duct. However, another 4 patients with stones or sludge in the duct did not show dilatation, so that the response to fat was a poor indicator of patients requiring common bile duct exploration. No patient had major symptoms after surgery. At 1 month and 12 months, the response to fat was variable with more than half of those tested showing no decrease in duct size. A more consistent pattern emerged at 5 years, when 14 of 18 patients tested showed a decrease in common hepatic duct after fat; 3 were unchanged and 1 increased by 1 mm. The response to fat was less consistent and more difficult to measure in the common bile duct, even 5 years after operation. It was concluded that not all patients with indications for exploration of the common bile duct on operative cholangiography show a dilatation response to fat on preoperative testing. Also, fatty meal sonography should be used with caution because the response to fat in asymptomatic patients soon after operation is unpredictable, with occasional patients showing dilation without apparent obstruction. Measurement of common hepatic duct is preferred to common bile duct and increases in diameter of 1 mm are probably not significant."}

However, the mechanism of this uncoupling phenomenon is still unclear. This study shows a comparison of the effects of ampicillin (18 mumol/100g body wt), sulfated taurolithocholic acid (0.2 and 1.0 mumol/100 g body wt), and indocyanine green (0.6 mumol/100 g body wt) in control and Groningen Yellow-Wistar rats with chronic (8 days) biliary drainage. Groningen Yellow rats have a hereditary defect in hepatobiliary transport of various organic anions. Bile secretion, but not hepatic uptake, of the three organic anions was strongly impaired in Groningen Yellow rats compared with controls. Ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid caused a strong uncoupling in control rats but had no effect or a much smaller effect on lipid secretion in Groningen Yellow rats. Indocyanine green did not affect lipid secretion, in either control or in Groningen Yellow rats. Gel-filtration chromatography of bile showed a specific coelution of ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid with the bile acid fraction, whereas indocyanine green coeluted with the phospholipid/cholesterol fraction. This study concludes that the uncoupling by ampicillin and sulfated taurolithocholic acid occurs after their secretion into bile and is caused by interaction of these compounds with bile acids. It is hypothesized that this interaction inhibits the capacity of bile acids to induce secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol into the bile."}

Bovine gallbladder mucin structure was studied after chemical deglycosylation by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at 23 degrees C for 3 hours. Deglycosylated mucin contained less than 5% of the amino sugar and neutral hexose content of native mucin. Electrophoretic and molecular sieve chromatographic analyses indicated that significant cleavage of the mucin polypeptide core had occurred during deglycosylation. Deglycosylated mucin was separated into three major fractions by reverse-phase chromatography, one of which was enriched with respect to threonine and proline. Tryptic peptides prepared from this fraction were purified by molecular sieve and reverse-phase chromatography, and the amino acid sequences (8-20 residues) of the four principal tryptic peptides were determined. These peptides contained 65%-75% threonine and proline residues and demonstrated 80%-100% sequence similarity. These data provide the first information on the primary structure of gallbladder mucin and suggest that repeating amino acid sequences occur in this protein. Comparison of gallbladder mucin peptide structure with the consensus repeat sequence of human intestinal mucin showed approximately 60% sequence similarity. It was concluded that mammalian gastrointestinal mucins may be derived from a common ancestral gene."}

The tortuosity of the abnormal vessel in this condition has been attributed to artefactual contraction of the stomach following excision and formalin fixation. This is the first reported case in which a pathologically proven lesion has been clearly visualized by angiography. This demonstrates that the submucosal vessel is truly and not artifactually sinuous. It is proposed that angiographic demonstration of a nontapering, convoluted artery in the territory of the left gastric artery is highly suggestive of caliber-persistent artery of the stomach."}

Twenty patients were enrolled with the diagnosis of distal esophageal stenosis, including benign peptic stricture (17), Schatski's ring (2), and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (1). Dilation attempts using only Maloney dilators were monitored fluoroscopically by the principle investigator, the physician and patient being unaware of the findings. Physicians then predicted whether or not their dilations were successful, and they examined various features to determine their usefulness in predicting successful dilation. They were able to predict successful dilation accurately in 97% of the cases studied; however, their predictions of unsuccessful dilation were correct only 60% of the time. Features helpful in predicting passage included easy passage of the dilator (98%) and the patient feeling the dilator in the stomach (95%). Excessive resistance suggesting unsuccessful passage was an unreliable feature and was often due to the dilator curling in the stomach. When Maloney dilators are used to dilate simple distal strictures, if the physician predicts successful passage, he is reliably accurate without the use of fluoroscopy; however, if unsuccessful passage is suspected, fluoroscopy must be used for confirmation."}

Thirty consecutive patients underwent a total of 249 biopsies, 124 with the disposable forceps, and 125 with reusable forceps. Biopsy locations included the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and common bile duct. Specimens were compared microscopically to determine overall surface area, depth, adequacy, and diagnostic result. The disposable biopsy forceps yielded specimens which were 37% smaller when compared with the reusable forceps. In five of the comparisons, minor differences in histological findings were noted between the two groups of biopsy specimens, but these differences did not alter the pathological diagnosis. However, in three cases in which superficial specimens were obtained, an underlying carcinoma was missed with the disposable forceps. Our study documents the utility of disposable biopsy forceps for mucosal lesions. In addition, there were 11 mechanical failures in 38 biopsy attempts with the plastic biopsy forceps. These forceps appear to be limited in their capacity to obtain adequate specimens from firm tissue or when submucosal biopsy samples are required, and they will require refinements in design to duplicate specimen quality obtained by traditional reusable forceps. Disposable forceps are particularly suitable for biopsy of mucosal lesions in patients with possible communicable disease, and they should help to reduce cross-contamination in the gastroenterology laboratory."}

Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01).

Values in smokers and non-smokers were similar, but smoking a cigarette was associated with a significant fall in blood flow (p less than 0.04) and this change was inversely related to the rise in plasma nicotine concentration (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05). The findings may be relevant to the association between colitis and the smoking history."}

Compared with pretreatment values, after macroscopic healing, a significant reduction in daytime median percentage of reflux time (10.0 v 6.5; p less than 0.05) and median number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes (5-5 v 1.0; p less than 0.05) were observed, whereas during night time reflux frequency and severity did not change. During maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg nocte, five of the six patients, who had shown no improvement in gastro-oesophageal reflux after acute healing, relapsed. These results suggest that, in contrast with previous work, a decrease in gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux oesophagitis can be achieved after macroscopic healing, and that the occurrence of such a reduction after acute healing is predictive of a good response to longterm treatment."}

It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety. This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease."}

Serum concentrations of sIL-2R were significantly raised in patients with active Crohn's disease compared with patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.001) and control subjects.

This study sought to carry these analyses one step further and investigate the distribution of inflammatory bowel disease by individual occupations. The German social security statistics for 'rehabilitation' were used to assess the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. From 1982 to 1988, a total of 12,014 people were granted rehabilitation as a result of inflammatory bowel disease. Low male prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease was found among bricklayers, road construction workers, unskilled workers in brick and stone, unskilled labourers, and security personnel. Low rates were found among women employed in cleaning and maintenance, and in those without occupation. In contrast, a high male prevalence was found among instrument makers, electricians, bakers, and technical assistants. Among female employees, inflammatory bowel disease was significantly associated with sales representatives, office workers, health occupations, and hairdressers. These associations were found in the complete data for 1982-8 as well as in the separate data for the two half periods 1982-5 and 1986-8. Highly significant correlations between the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were found among both male and female employees. It seems that occupations involving work in the open air and physical exercise are protective, while being exposed to air conditioned artificial working conditions or extended and irregular shift working confer a risk of contracting inflammatory bowel disease."}

The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100%), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5)%, p less than 0.05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5)%, p less than 0.01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2.62 (0.16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2.45 (0.17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4)%, p less than 0.001, and 71 (4)%, p less than 0.001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis."}

Both at rest and during transmural stimulation the release of acetylcholine was significantly higher in the spastic (aganglionic) segment than in the proximal dilated bowel. Significant differences were found in the tissue concentration of acetylcholine between ganglionic and aganglionic specimens. The pattern of response to transmural stimulation was also different in the spastic and dilated bowel. Transmural stimulation induced relaxation and contraction in ganglionic specimens but only contractions in aganglionic specimens. The sensitivity of the smooth muscle in the aganglionic portion to exogenous acetylcholine and to field stimulation was found to be higher than in the ganglionic portion. While noradrenaline added to the organ bath reduced the stimulation-evoked release of acetylcholine from spastic segments, via an alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated process, yohimbine did not enhance the release. It is suggested that in Hirschsprung's disease the increased acetylcholine release, the enhanced sensitivity of smooth muscle cells to acetylcholine, and the lack of alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated noradrenergic modulation of acetylcholine release from cholinergic interneurons might be responsible for the spasm of aganglionic segments."}

Although conduction in the pudendo-anal reflex arc may be prolonged, and is so in neurogenic faecal incontinence, it must be shown to be present before the method can be used. This stimulation results in an immediate rise in the pressure in the anal canal and a significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the external anal sphincter. Maintenance of the stimulus over a two month period raised the mean resting pressure significantly in the anal canal and increased the reflex and voluntary responses of the external anal sphincter to coughing and squeezing actions respectively. The length of the sphincter was not affected. There was widening of the mean motor unit potential duration, though this was not significant. The resting electromyogram was enhanced after the course of treatment, indicating greater spontaneous activity in the external sphincter.

All normal subjects perceived a rectal sensation within one second of rapid inflation of a rectal balloon with volumes of 20 ml or less air. Six patients did not perceive any rectal sensation until 60 ml had been introduced, while in the remaining nine patients the sensation was delayed by at least two seconds. Internal sphincter relaxation occurred before the sensation was perceived in three of 27 normal subjects and 11 of 16 patients (p less than 0.001), and could be associated with anal leakage, which stopped as soon as sensation was perceived. The lowest rectal volumes required to induce anal relaxation, to cause sustained relaxation, or to elicit sensations of a desire to defecate or pain were similar in patients and normal subjects. In conclusion, these results show the close association between rectal sensation and external anal sphincter contraction, and show that faecal incontinence may occur as a result of delayed or absent external anal sphincter contraction when the internal anal sphincter is relaxed."}

Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l."}

The manometric results show that the motor changes found in the Barrett's group are specific but similar to the motor dysfunction associated with reflux oesophagitis. Motor anomalies are probably related more to the inflammatory process in the oesophageal wall than to the metaplastic changes themselves. The pH monitoring results show that while reflux in the Barrett's oesophagus patients was greater overall than in the oesophagitis group without Barrett's oesophagus, the changes are similar when the results are compared with the severe oesophagitis group.

On review, only 20 of the 40 patients were considered to have true dysplasia: seven patients had low grade dysplasia and 13 had high grade dysplasia. Of the 13 patients with high grade dysplasia, 11 (85%) were found to have gastric cancer within 15 months. Of the 10 patients with high grade dysplasia who underwent gastrectomy, six were found to have early gastric cancer, three had cancer invading into the muscularis propria, and none had lymph node metastases. High grade dysplasia is thus a marker of gastric cancer. Moreover, the cancers associated with high grade dysplasia are usually pathologically favourable and curable. The finding, by an experienced pathologist, of high grade dysplasia in two separate sets of endoscopic biopsies is therefore an indication for radical surgical treatment, provided that the patient's age and general condition permit such an approach."}

Twenty seven (93%) of the isolates were sensitive before treatment while six of seven (86%) were resistant afterwards. Four of the six resistant strains had acquired resistance during treatment and one of these had acquired metronidazole resistance despite concomitant treatment with amoxycillin, to which it remained sensitive. CBS with adjuvant metronidazole at a dose of 400 mg tid for seven days significantly improves the eradication of H pylori compared with CBS alone.

Two situations may arise depending on whether there is enough bile salt in proportion to cholesterol to complete this \"maturation\" process. If the cholesterol saturation is low, at equilibrium the bile salts will have completely micellized the vesicles. On the other hand, if bile is saturated with cholesterol, the micellation process is incomplete and vesicles and micelles will be present at equilibrium. The residual vesicle in this latter situation may have a higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio because of the greater propensity of phospholipid to be micellized. This situation may result in cholesterol nucleation. The mechanism of nucleation from vesicles and the possible role of nucleating and antinucleating proteins in this process have been discussed."}

Static light-scattering measurements of biliary lipid aggregates provide molecular weights and important information concerning particle shape, whereas quasielastic (also referred to as dynamic) light-scattering measurements assess particle sizes and polydispersities. Under favorable circumstances, quasielastic light scattering allows simultaneous determinations of sizes and concentrations of coexisting particle populations. The use of laser light-scattering technology in solving the solution properties and the physicochemical structures of model and native biles is detailed. In view of the extraordinarily diverse backgrounds of researchers in the gallstone field (e.g., internists, surgeons, biochemists, physicists), we believe that the present article (which relies heavily on graphical representations) will afford a better understanding of the usefulness and limitations of laser light-scattering techniques, particularly in their applications to the study of bile."}

Increments in bile salt concentration in the elution buffer caused progressive disappearance of vesicles and a rise in their cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. Using the standard chromatographic technique, analyses of the same bile gave reproducible results, and comparisons among various biles were possible. Quantitative light scattering measurements of bile showed that the amount of vesicular cholesterol in whole unprocessed bile was similar to that measured by Sephacryl chromatography. Analyses of human gallbladder biles using a high-resolution Sephacryl column showed four cholesterol-containing peaks: vesicles, lamellae, mixed micelles and an undefined carrier. This long chromatographic column separated the lamellar from the micellar peaks (which had merged on the short column). Phospholipid lamellae solubilized most of the biliary cholesterol. These findings were confirmed by ultracentrifugation of bile."}

The method was designed to decrease the potential pitfalls of classic ultracentrifugation: osmotic effects of the centrifugation media and hydrostatic pressure effects generated in the centrifuge tube. This was accomplished by using metrizamide as an inert centrifugation medium for isopyknic separation and a vertical rotor. The buoyant density of vesicles isolated from human native bile varied between 1.010 and 1.030 gm/ml, as determined in preformed bile-metrizamide density gradients after 285 min of centrifugation. When 16% metrizamide was directly dissolved in bile, its density increased to 1.060 gm/ml. After 120 min of centrifugation, it was found that more than 95% of total vesicular cholesterol floated at the top of the centrifuge tube. This fraction appeared as one or two white opalescent bands. The present ultracentrifugal method was validated by gel filtration chromatography. It was found that more than 95% of vesicular cholesterol migrated to the top 0.4 ml of the centrifuge tube after the short-run centrifugation. Approximately 5% of total biliary cholesterol present in the vesicular fractions was in fact solubilized in mixed micelles as assessed by gel filtration chromatography. Although the proportion of vesicles and micelles estimated with the present ultracentrifugal method is in the range reported by other authors using the more common chromatographic method, we believe that our method has two major advantages. First, it eliminates the dilutional effect of buffers necessary for gel filtration chromatography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

This fact supports the concept that biliary cholesterol is normally secreted in phospholipid vesicles from the hepatocyte into the canaliculus. The fundamental aspects of biliary lipid secretion relate first to the quantitative determinants of hepatocytic cholesterol secretion into the bile and, second, to the cell biology of this process. There is a tight curvilinear coupling between the rates of bile acids and biliary lipid secretion in all animal species. The hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool may modify this cosecretory mechanism in that more hydrophobic bile acids recruit more phospholipid and cholesterol per mole of bile acid secreted into the bile. The quantitative significance of this effect, however, is relatively minor. In contrast, intrahepatic determinants, such as the rates of hepatic cholesterol esterification and very low density lipoprotein production modulated by dietary factors, may markedly change the amount of cholesterol carried in vesicles into the bile. Recent studies provide strong evidence to support the concept that biliary cholesterol output is also modulated by the amount of free cholesterol available in specific regions of the endoplasmic reticulum for recruitment by the bile acid cosecretory mechanism. The origin of biliary lipids is in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The intracellular transport and the canalicular secretory mechanism of the precursor of biliary lipid vesicles is mostly unknown. Two theories related to the cell biology of biliary lipid secretion are discussed in this article, the fusion-budding model and the exocytotic model."}

As biliary lipids are concentrated within the biliary tree and gallbladder, bile salts structurally alter lecithin-cholesterol vesicles to form a variety of metastable aggregates whose structures and phase transformations are predicted by phase equilibria considerations. These structural transformations ultimately result in the dispersion of biliary lipids as thermodynamically stable micelles or micelles plus thermodynamically unstable vesicles in common duct and gallbladder biles. The experiments reviewed herein represent experimental simulations of these processes. We used pure aqueous lipid systems to model the putative stages of biliary lipid aggregation on the basis of interactions of small unilamellar vesicles of lecithin-cholesterol with bile salts as the latter's concentrations were varied from below to well above the critical micellar concentration. With submicellar bile salt concentrations likely to be found within hepatocytes, vesicle structures are not appreciably altered. However, perimicellar bile salt concentrations possibly occurring in canaliculi and bile ductules induce the formation of a hexagonal rodlike phase. On further increases in bile salt concentration, the hexagonal rods (formed from lecithin-rich and cholesterol-poor vesicles) are dissolved into mixed micelles as bile salt concentrations exceed their critical micellar concentrations. In slightly cholesterol-\"supersaturated\" biles, the rapid dissolution of this intermediate phase results in the formation of cholesterol-supersaturated mixed micelles that, in time, give rise to a new population of cholesterol-rich vesicles that coexist with saturated micelles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

This equilibrium solubilizing ratio is an increasing function of the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. In contrast, the concentration of sodium cholate required for solubilization of vesicles made of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol does not increase by increasing the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. Consequently, the latter solubilization procedure yields metastable mixed micelles whenever the cholate concentration is higher than that required for vesicle solubilization but lower than that needed for establishing a micellar equilibrium. These metastable mixed micelles undergo partial revesiculation to form cholesterol-rich vesicles that subsequently aggregate. Cholesterol crystallization appears to occur through its reorganization within these aggregated vesicles. The overall rate of the above series of processes increases sharply with the total lipid concentration and with the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio. The dependence of the rate on the effective ratio of bile salts/lipids is very complex: at any given ratio of cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine within the range of 0.3 to 0.5, increasing the cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine ratio requires higher cholate concentrations for the formation of stable mixed micelles (higher equilibrium solubilizing ratio). On the other hand, the metastable mixed micellar larsystems are long-lived whenever the effective ratio of cholate/lipids is lower than a critical value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Based on these considerations, the so-called nucleation time assay can at best only be taken as an empirical parameter. Nucleation (operationally defined) and growth of cholesterol monohydrate crystals in both model and native biles occurs rapidly after aggregation of supersaturated vesicles.

Efficient hepatic clearance of bile acids involves several active systems and passive uptake. Formation of coenzyme A derivatives prevents reflux of lipophilic dihydroxy bile acids. Biotransformation of bile acids during hepatocyte transport involves both type I and type II biotransformations. The major type II biotransformation is reamidation of unconjugated bile acids, but sulfation and glucuronidation also occur. The only major type I biotransformation is oxidoreduction, which converts iso- or 3 oxo bile acids to the preferred 3 alpha-hydroxy form and 7 oxo bile acids to their corresponding 7 alpha-hydroxy derivatives. Secretion of bile acids into the canaliculus is concentrative and induces osmotic flow of plasma water and solutes across the paracellular junctions between the space of Disse and the canaliculus. Bile flow in man is characterized by its low volume and by a paucity of bile acid-independent flow when compared with that of other mammals. Bile acid secretion also induces biliary lipid secretion, but some lipid secretion appears to be bile acid independent. The lipid vesicles secreted in human bile have a much higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio than those of other mammals. During flow down the biliary tree, vesicles are solubilized by bile acid micelles, and Ca++ ions are complexed by bile acid monomers and micelles. However, the biochemical mechanisms and factors regulating biliary lipid secretion in man are poorly understood."}

Hypersecretion of gallbladder mucus occurs in response to a lithogenic diet in experimental animals, and mucus accumulates as a viscous gel within the gallbladder lumen before gallstone formation. In both animals and man, the initial stage of cholesterol gallstone formation, the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals, occurs within the mucus gel. Inhibition of mucus secretion with aspirin prevents gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog, indicating the importance of mucus in gallstone formation. Mucin contains domains that bind cholesterol and lecithin transported as vesicles in supersaturated bile. Furthermore, mucin accelerates the nucleation of cholesterol crystals in both supersaturated model and native biles. Binding of cholesterol-enriched vesicles to hydrophobic domains on the mucin protein core appears to be critical for the acceleration of cholesterol crystal nucleation by mucin. Further study of the structure and function of gallbladder mucin should help to elucidate the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis."}

The concanavalin A-binding pronucleator affects cholesterol solubilization in model bile in two ways. It induces a shift of cholesterol and phospholipid from the micellar to the vesicular phase but also interacts directly with cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles. The concanavalin A-binding protein fraction contains at least two different promoting factors with gel permeation molecular weights of about 150 kD and 5 kD, respectively. The higher molecular weight activity could be assigned to a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 130 kD. Concanavalin A-binding-promoting activity was present in bile from both patients with and without stones, indicating that it is a normal constituent of bile.

Progress in purification of biliary effector proteins has been slow and hindered by the lack of a sensitive and convenient assay method. The formidable problems of removing large amounts of both mucin and lipids from the samples before isolation of biliary proteins has constituted another major obstacle. Recently, the combination of a newly developed nucleation and crystal growth assay and the systematic use of lectin affinity chromatography has enabled rapid progress to be made. With these approaches, glycoprotein fractions containing primarily inhibiting activity and other fractions containing primarily promoting activity have been isolated from normal human biles. Thus these opposing activities can coexist and influence a balance of effects potentially defining the presence of health or disease. The most recent studies have led to the isolation of a single glycoprotein having an extremely potent crystal growth-inhibiting activity."}

It layers in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and shifts with positioning. Particulate matter in bile, such as cholesterol monohydrate crystals, has been shown to be echogenic. Agglomeration of these crystals in biles with high mucus content accounts for the layering and the characteristic appearance of the movement of sludge with alteration in patient position. Within the gallbladder, the stability of the vesicular form of cholesterol and protein-lipid interactions are important determinants of cholesterol precipitation. In mixed and pigment gallstones, the equilibrium between ionized and unionized calcium and the hydrolysis of conjugated bilirubin are also important factors. Although the risk factors contributing to the formation of gallbladder sludge have not been critically examined, it is now known that in some instances sludge can produce biliary pain and can be associated with acalculous cholecystitis, recurrent pancreatitis and, ultimately, the formation of gallstones.

Although the current symposium is targeted primarily toward cholesterol gallstones, there are several areas in which understanding of biliary calcium may significantly contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cholesterol, as well as \"pigment\" (calcium salt), gallstones. Five broad areas are considered in relation to biliary calcium: (a) physiology (calcium entry into bile), (b) biophysics (the regulation of biliary free [Ca+(+)] as related to Gibbs-Donnan equilibria, (c) physical chemistry (the physicochemical state of calcium in bile, (d) thermodynamics (calcium solubility in bile), and (e) kinetics (pronucleating and antinucleating factors and metastable states).

The pigments are primarily monomeric calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin anions and/or an insoluble, black, network polymer of tetrapyrroles. Bilirubin presumably can precipitate only if bile is supersaturated with calcium bilirubinates. Among various in vitro model systems, the aqueous solubilities and pK'a values for unconjugated bilirubin differ greatly. It is therefore not known whether normal bile is saturated with unconjugated bilirubin. However, all systems indicate that unconjugated bilirubin is solubilized by binding to bile salt monomers and oligomers, as well as micelles; marked metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin can occur in the presence of bile salt micelles, and both pK'a values of unconjugated bilirubin are greater than 6.0, probably because of internal hydrogen-bonding of the--COOH groups. Lecithin decreases equilibrium solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin crystals but enhances metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. Calcium ions form insoluble salts with unconjugated bilirubin monoanions and dianions but soluble complexes with bilirubin conjugates. The solubility products of the calcium bilirubinate salts suggest that normal hepatic bile is not saturated with CaB or Ca(HB)2 but that gallbladder bile may be supersaturated with Ca(HB)2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

This, in turn, largely explains the prolonged stability of cholesterol solubilized in supersaturated human bile. Under certain overall compositional conditions for a supersaturated native bile, the vesicular phase in its contribution to total cholesterol transport also becomes supersaturated in cholesterol. Because of this, the vesicles also become unstable, leading to formation of cholesterol crystals. A simple but common example of one factor affecting composition in this way is concentration of total solutes, especially the biliary lipids. Conversely, dilution of bile (e.g., hepatic bile) markedly reduces the cholesterol saturation level in biliary vesicles. The result is that such vesicles become much more stable. Under these conditions, cholesterol crystal formation becomes unlikely and rarely, if ever, occurs."}

Studies of aqueous bile salt-lecithin systems have indicated three important aggregation regimens dependent on the lecithin/bile salt molar ratio and total solute concentration. Region I of the phase diagram, which includes the lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration values found in most mammalian biles, corresponds to a population of \"simple\" bile salt micelles coexisting in equilibrium with a population of mixed bile salt-lecithin micelles. Region II contains only mixed micelles, whose apparent size and shape vary with lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration in a manner consistent with a \"mixed disc\" model. In this model, bile salts not only coat the perimeter of the disc (as proposed in Small's original model) but are also incorporated within the lecithin bilayer, possibly as hydrogen-bonded dimers. Finally, in region III, where total solute concentration values are typically less than the critical micelle concentration of the pure bile salt, the systems contain mixed vesicles (spherical bilayer shells) whose size (approximately 130 to 500A) depends on lecithin/bile salt and total solute concentration in accordance with a simple partition equilibrium that determines the composition of the mixed vesicle bilayer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

The common bile salts possess a steroid nucleus of four fused hydrocarbon rings with polar hydroxyl functions and an aliphatic side chain conjugated in amide linkage with glycine or taurine. Since the ionized carboxylate or sulfonate group on the side chain renders bile salts water soluble, they are formally classified as soluble amphiphiles. The common bile salts differ in the number and orientation of the hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus. Bile salts synthesized from cholesterol in the liver are called primary bile salts, which in humans are cholate, with three hydroxyl groups, and chenodeoxycholate, with two hydroxyl groups. Secondary bile salts are created by the action of intestinal bacteria on primary bile salts; deoxycholate, with two hydroxyl groups, and lithocholate, with a single hydroxyl group, are formed from cholate and chenodeoxycholate, respectively. \"Tertiary\" bile salts are the result of modification of secondary bile salts by intestinal flora or hepatocytes; in humans these are the sulfate ester of lithocholate and ursodeoxycholate, the 7 beta-epimer of chenodeoxycholate. Lecithin (diacylphosphatidylcholine), the major phospholipid in bile, is an insoluble, swelling amphiphile with a hydrophilic, zwitterionic phosphocholine head group and hydrophobic tails comprised of two long fatty acyl chains. Biliary lecithin is derived from the least hydrophobic hepatic lecithins and typically contains a saturated C-16 acyl chain in the sn-1 position and an unsaturated C-18 or C-20 acyl chain in the sn-2 position.

Much of our current knowledge concerning the mechanism of membrane fusion has been derived from studies using simple artificial membranes, such as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles, as model systems. A most essential feature of these studies has been the development of membrane fusion assays that register in a sensitive and continuous fashion the mixing of membranes or the aqueous volumes initially enclosed by these membranes. Not only do these assays allow one to readily detect and quantify fusion, but they also provide the possibility to relate the kinetics of fusion to the rate by which certain molecular changes in membranes take place. Obviously, this insight is of relevance for understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion. The principles and applications of some representative assays that rely on the use of fluorescence spectroscopy will be discussed. Assays that monitor membrane mixing are commonly based on the detection of changes in resonance energy transfer efficiency or the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of appropriate fluorescent lipid analogs.

The apposition or fusion of the membranes may provide the third dimension within which the cholesterol domains on apposed or collapsed membranes can begin to form the monohydrate crystal.

Mixed cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing more than equimolar cholesterol are metastable; on storage excess cholesterol is released from the vesicles and forms cholesterol monohydrate crystals. This process models the formation of cholesterol gallstones in bile and the growth of the crystals probably involves, at least in part, diffusion of cholesterol molecules from the vesicle bilayer to the crystal surface. The cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine interaction energy in the lipid-water interface of the donor vesicle has a critical effect on the rate of this transfer process."}

A kinetic analysis of the rates of phospholipid transfer between vesicles indicated that transfer occurs predominantly as soluble monomers moving through the water phase. Transfer between mixed micelles was found to occur by the same aqueous diffusion mechanism at low lipid concentrations, but at high lipid concentrations, transfer occurs predominantly during transient micelle collisions. The faster rate of transfer between mixed micelles relative to vesicles results both from the collision-dependent transfer and from an increase in the rate-limiting step for aqueous diffusion-phospholipid dissociation from the micelle surface. The relative contribution of collision-dependent transfer to the overall transfer rate increases with phospholipid acyl chain length and total lipid concentration.

In light of the discovery of the cholesterol-lecithin vesicles as significant cholesterol carriers, there is a need to reevaluate this old concept. This study examined the feasibility of the silicone polymer uptake method for the direct determination of the cholesterol thermodynamic activity in model bile systems. In cases of unsaturation and near saturation, a linear relationship was observed between the cholesterol concentration in the silicone polymer at equilibrium and the cholesterol saturation index (the cholesterol concentration in the aqueous micellar solution at equilibrium/cholesterol monohydrate solubility in the same medium) for taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate systems either containing or not containing lecithin. In taurocholate-lecithin solutions supersaturated with cholesterol, the linear relationship continued to hold up to the point where vesicles started to form. Vesicle formation initiated a negative deviation from linearity. At constant lecithin concentration, the cholesterol thermodynamic activity at which vesicle formation began was a function of the taurocholate/lecithin ratio; the larger the taurocholate/lecithin ratio, the higher the cholesterol thermodynamic activity for the onset of vesicle formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

At equilibrium, the possible number and types of different cholesterol \"carriers\" are limited by constraints placed by the phase rule.

We also reinterpret published lipid compositions of phases separated from human bile, using both a nonequilibrium \"phase diagram\" and an equilibrium phase diagram for the model system, taurocholate-egg yolk lecithin-cholesterol. From these analyses, we conclude that precise quantitation of cholesterol \"carriers\" in bile awaits methods to accurately determine the intermicellar-intervesicular concentration of bile salts in any individual bile, as well as advances in nonperturbing separatory procedures, and methods to control the thermal and temporal history of native bile samples."}

Chronic ethanol consumption impairs polyamine synthesis during the prereplicative phase after partial hepatectomy. To determine whether this delay in polyamine synthesis contributes to ethanol's inhibition of liver regeneration, the ability of supplemental putrescine to improve regeneration in ethanol-fed rats was tested. Chronically ethanol-fed rats and isocalorically maintained controls underwent partial hepatectomy and were injected intraperitoneally with saline or putrescine (0.03 or 0.30 mmol/kg) at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hr after partial hepatectomy. Rats were killed at 24, 48 or 72 hr, 1 hr after exposure to [3H]thymidine, so that DNA synthesis could be estimated. DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited in ethanol-fed rats treated with saline compared with saline-treated pair-fed controls. Supplemental putrescine did not affect DNA synthesis in pair-fed rats. In contrast, putrescine significantly improved [3H]thymidine incorporation 24 to 72 hr after partial hepatectomy in ethanol-fed rats. Intraperitoneal injection of putrescine (1.2 mmol/kg) at the time of partial hepatectomy increased hepatic polyamine concentrations for the first 6 hr after partial hepatectomy despite significantly inhibiting the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis, in both groups. Hepatic polyamine levels after putrescine injection were greater in ethanol-fed rats than in similarly treated controls. These data suggest that putrescine treatment triggers events that normalize DNA synthesis in ethanol-fed rats. These results confirm the hypothesis that ethanol's antiregenerative mechanism intimately involves inhibition of putrescine synthesis."}

To examine this possibility, the susceptibility of Hep G2 cells to infection with a variety of rotavirus strains was tested. These cells were used because they are considered to be well differentiated and exhibit many liver-specific functions. The Hep G2 cells supported the growth of the simian strain rhesus rotavirus (MMU 18006), a strain currently being used in vaccine trails, but did not support the growth of any human strain (D, DS1, Price or ST3). The rhesus rotavirus infection was cytopathic and resulted in release of lactate dehydrogenase. Rhesus rotavirus growth in Hep G2 cells displayed trypsin-enhanced infectivity and was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase but not with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens. Hep G2 cells were also permissive for another simian strain (SA11), a bovine strain (UK) and single gene substitution reassortants containing VP7 (the major outer capsid neutralization protein) from a human rotavirus strain and the remaining 10 genes from either rhesus rotavirus or UK. In general, UK and its reassortants produced lower levels of antigen than did rhesus rotavirus and its reassortants. Hep G2 cells and other hepatic cell lines may prove to be useful tools to explore the hepatotropic potential of wild-type rotaviruses and candidate vaccine strains."}

These findings are distinctive with Kupffer cells because splenic macrophages did not exert such inhibition in parallel experiments. Moreover, the supernatant collected from the 24-hr culture of nonparenchymal liver cells contained greater than 20-fold more prostaglandin E2 and interferon alpha/beta than that from culture of spleen cells.

The reactivity of the serum with sulfatide was diminished by preincubation of the serum with galactosylceramide-6-sulfate and sulfatide, indicating that the antibody reacted with sulfated galactosylceramide regardless of the position of the sulfate residue.

Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm.

Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy.

Sulfate esters of chenodeoxycholic acid are the most abundant of these bile acid sulfates. These compounds are taken up by the liver and excreted into bile, although their plasma clearance and biliary excretion are reduced compared with that of unsulfated bile acids. It is not clear whether this is due to differences in intrinsic hepatic uptake or biliary excretion. In the present study, single-pass transport kinetics of chenodeoxycholic acid 3-alpha-sulfate, chenodeoxycholic acid 7-alpha-sulfate and unsulfated chenodeoxycholic acid were quantified in isolated perfused rat liver. Influx of the 7-alpha- and 3-alpha-sulfated derivatives was 57% and 20% that of chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively. These three compounds bound to albumin equally well, indicating that this was not a factor in their differential uptake. Although single-pass extraction of material taken up by the liver was identical. There was no difference in bile flow or biliary excretion of material taken up by the liver was identical. There was no difference in bile flow or biliary excretion rate, regardless of which bile acid sulfate was tested. These results indicate that the low plasma elimination of sulfated bile acids previously observed by others can be explained by low hepatic influx. The diminished transport into liver resulting from sulfation could lead to enhanced elimination of bile acids by the kidney."}

We recently experienced an autopsy case of systemic amyloidosis presenting the amyloid deposits in the intrahepatic biliary tree. This experience prompted us to survey 19 autopsy cases of systemic amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition was found just under the lining epithelium of the intrahepatic large bile duct in 10 of 19 cases and around the peribiliary glandular acini in 7 of the 19 cases, respectively. Amyloid deposition in the intrahepatic large bile duct and peribiliary glands was positively correlated with the degree of amyloid deposition in the liver but not with type of amyloid protein. Double-staining of amyloid and vascular endothelium disclosed that amyloid deposition was more closely related to the inner part of the peribiliary vascular plexus and to the vascular plexus encircling the peribiliary glands than the lining biliary epithelium and peribiliary glandular acinar cells themselves. The exact pathogenesis of amyloid deposition in these anatomical components, however, remains unclear. Although our cases failed to show any overt clinical symptomatologies related to amyloid deposition in these biliary components, it seems conceivable that more massive amyloid deposition in these anatomical components could give rise to some clinical symptoms."}

Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma. Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period. Each had at least one brushing. Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures. Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy. Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings. Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells. Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing. In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found. However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing. A single negative or suspicious cytological finding decreased the probability of bile duct carcinoma to 43%. Two and three sequential negative tests reduced the probability to 32% and 0%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

All patients were diagnosed between 1983 and 1987. A multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model) using clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographical and pathological data obtained at diagnosis disclosed that bilirubin (p = 0.0001), ascites (p = 0.0001), toxic syndrome (defined by the presence of weight loss greater than 10% premorbid weight, malaise and anorexia) (p = 0.009), blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.025), tumor size (p = 0.001), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (p = 0.0006), age (p = 0.0005), serum sodium (p = 0.003) and presence of metastases (p = 0.002) were independent predictors of survival. According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model, a prognostic index was constructed allowing division of patients in different groups according to their relative risk of death: RRD = EXP (Age x 0.03 + Ascites x 0.8281 + BUN x 0.0137 + Serum sodium x (-0.0538) + gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase x 0.0019 + Bilirubin x 0.0734 + Tumor size x 0.33 + Toxic syndrome x 0.4965 + Metastases x 0.55).

The sporadic appearance of incidental benign lesions and variability in scanning techniques, equipment and artifacts add difficulties to the evaluation of liver masses. Therefore we emphasize the need to define the problem for which the patient is being imaged. This information helps in choosing the procedure of choice and the technique needed to give the most expedient, accurate answer. This will also help apply the lowest risk and most cost-efficient care. Imaging algorithms vary depending on the suspected pathological conditions. Dynamic bolus-enhanced CT is the modality of choice in most situations. Tc99m sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scans are helpful in patients with suspected FNH, and Tc99m-tagged-RBC-SPECT scans are recommended to confirm cavernous hemangiomas. Cysts are easily confirmed by US. Although MRI is competitive with CT, it has not become a primary modality because of cost, availability, patient selection and variability of scanner capabilities among the many manufacturers and models. It is hard to predict what future development of imaging techniques will bring. Many feel that significant advances have plateaued. Time and money will more likely be concentrated on improving image resolution, speed of scanning and ability to transfer this information to sites outside of the radiology department. In addition to faster scanning, we expect to soon have available safe intravenous and enteric contrast agents for MRI. Certainly this will lead to a new round of investigations to compare MRI with CT scanning."}

Its very wide distribution in the body and its activity in vitro indicate involvement in the metabolism of other biologically active peptides. The recent molecular cloning of the human enzyme confirmed the existence of a hydrophobic C-terminal peptide that forms the short transmembrane domain of this plasma membrane-bound enzyme. The much longer external portion contains two homologous active site domains but probably only one functional active center. Finally, in spite of the great progress made in studying angiotensin converting enzyme, there are many challenging problems waiting to be solved."}

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been demonstrated in conduit arteries in vivo and in the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and femoral vascular beds as well as in the microcirculation of the brain and the microcirculation of cremaster muscle. The available evidence, although not complete, strongly suggests that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by acetylcholine in the cerebral microcirculation is a nitrosothiol. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by bradykinin in this vascular bed is an oxygen radical generated in association with enhanced arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase. In the microcirculation of skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the vasodilation from bradykinin is mediated partly by prostacyclin and partly by an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that generated by acetylcholine. Basal secretion of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is controversial in vivo but is usually present in vitro. On the other hand, it appears that endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediates flow-dependent vasodilation in both large vessels and in the microcirculation in vivo. The generation and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelium may be abnormal in a variety of conditions including acute and chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemia followed by reperfusion. Several mechanisms for these abnormalities have been identified. These include inability to generate endothelium-derived relaxing factor or destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by oxidants after its release in the extracellular space. These abnormalities in endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in these conditions."}

The salt-sensitive patients in whom the increase in total peripheral resistance was greater than the increase in cardiac index with salt loading were termed SST. In the salt-sensitive patients termed SSC, the increase in cardiac index was greater than the increase in total peripheral resistance with increased sodium intake. All SST patients on day 7 of the high sodium diet remained in the SST group on day 14. Nine of 13 patients in the SSC group on day 7 remained in the SSC group on day 14, and the remaining four patients in the SSC group on day 7 fell into the SST group on day 14. Four of eight non-salt-sensitive (NSS) patients on day 7 of the high salt regimen remained in the NSS group on day 14, whereas the remaining four patients in the NSS group on day 7 fell into the SSC group on day 14. Our data suggest a changing pattern with sodium loading of initially high cardiac index followed by a persistently raised total peripheral resistance. The celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries vasoconstricted with sodium repletion in both SST and SSC patients. With salt loading, the terminal aortic vascular bed vasodilated in the SSC patients and vasoconstricted in the SST patients."}
